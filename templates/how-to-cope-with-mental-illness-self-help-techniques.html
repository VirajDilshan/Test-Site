                symptoms or how you feel. In addition, consider involving your family members or your friends to watch
                for warning signs.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Value yourself</strong></h3>
            <p>Always treat yourself with kindness and respect, and avoid self-criticism. Most importantly, make time
                for your hobbies and favourite projects, or stretch your horizons. Do a daily crossword puzzle, plant
                a garden, take dance lessons or try learning a new language.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Surround yourself with good people</strong></h3>
            <p>Generally, people with strong family or social connections are healthier than those who lack a support
                network. Make plans with your family members and friends, or seek out activities where you can meet
                new people, such as a club, class or support group.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Quiet your mind</strong></h3>
            <p>To quiet your mind, firstly, try meditating, Mindfulness or prayer. As a result, relaxing, exercising
                and praying can improve your state of mind and outlook on life. In fact, researches show that meditation
                may help you feel calm and increase the effects of therapy. However, to get connected, see spiritual
                resources on personal well-being.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Stay connected with friends and family</strong></h3>
            <p>Always try to participate in social activities, and get together with family or friends regularly.
                Ask for help when you need it, and be honest with your loved ones about how you’re doing.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Get routine medical care</strong></h3>
            <p>Don’t avoid checkups or skip visits to your primary care provider, especially if you aren’t feeling well.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You may have a new health problem that needs to be treated</li>
                <li>You may be experiencing side effects of medication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br></p>

            <h2 id="topic-5">Keep a Journal</h2>
            <p>Keep a journal or jot down brief thoughts or record symptoms on a smartphone app. For instance, keeping
                track of your personal life and sharing information with your therapist can help you on how to cope
                with your illness. In addition, it’s also a healthy way to explore and express pain, anger, fear
                and all your other emotions.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Set realistic goals</strong></h3>
            <p>Firstly, decide what you want to achieve academically, professionally and personally. Secondly, write
                down the steps you need to realize your goals. Always aim high, but be realistic and don’t over-schedule.
                You’ll enjoy a huge sense of accomplishment and self-worth as you progress toward your goal. For
                example, wellness coaching can help you develop goals and stay on track.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Learn how to deal with stress </strong></h3>
            <p>Whether you like it or not, stress is a part of life. Don’t forget to practice good coping skills. For
                example, try One-Minute Stress Strategies, do Tai Chi, exercise, take a walk, play with your pet. Also,
                never forget to smile and see the humour in life. That is to say, researches show that laughter can
                boost your immune system, ease pain, and reduce stress.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Avoid alcohol and other drugs</strong></h3>
            <p>Keep alcohol use to a minimum and avoid other drugs as much as possible. Most of the time people use
                alcohol and other drugs to “self-medicate” but in reality, alcohol and other drugs only cause more
                problems.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Break up the monotony</strong></h3>
            <p>Our daily routines make us more structured and enhance our feelings of safety. But a little change of
                this pace can cheer up a boring schedule. For example, alter your jogging route, plan a road trip with
                your friends, take a walk in a different park, or try a new restaurant.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Take good care of yourself</strong></h3>
            <p>Enough sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity are important. Therefore, try to maintain a
                regular schedule as much as you can. Talk to your therapist if you have trouble sleeping, eating or
                physical activities.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Get help when you need it</strong></h3>
            <p>Seeking help when you need it is a sign of strength — not a weakness. However, it is important to
                remember that getting treatment is effective. People who get necessary care can recover from mental
                illness and addiction and lead full, rewarding lives.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Join a support group</strong></h3>
            <p>Connecting and sharing with others facing similar challenges may help you cope with mental illness and
                self treat a mental illness. In other words, support groups for mental illness are available in many
                communities and even online.</p>
            <p><br></p>

            <h2 id="topic-6">Self-care and Mental health</h2>
            <h3><strong>What is self-care?</strong></h3>
            <p>Self-care is providing enough attention to your own psychological and emotional wellbeing. This may be a
                bit of an unclear description, the truth is, self-care doesn’t look the same for any two people. When
                they try to cope with mental illness, the way might be slightly different and so does when they self
                treat a mental illness.</p>
            <p>For outgoing people, being around other people in a social setting may meet their emotional needs.
                However, backward people may prefer an evening watching a movie with a close friend or significant
                other to get their social needs met. Some vow by warm bubble baths, and quiet music, while others want
                to hit the gym, drink a coffee, or even take some time to clean their living space thoroughly.</p>
            <p>There are practically many endless ways to practice self-care. Likewise, it all boils down to doing
                things that you enjoy or require.</p>
            <p>Many people tend to think of pampering themselves or spoiling in guilty pleasures as self-care. But, it
                never just ends there. Self-care also encloses all the things you need to do to remain healthy, and
                feel as mentally well as possible. Self-care plays a huge role in mental illness when you are trying
                to cope with it.</p>
            <p>This means that getting a massage is self-care, but so is cleaning your home to reduce some stress.
                Enjoying ice cream on a warm day is self-care. But so does attending a therapy session to address your
                emotional needs, trauma, or mental illnesses.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>What is mental health?</strong></h3>
            <p>Mental health is our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It influences how we think, feel,
                and act. It also helps decide how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is
                very important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
            <p>Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behaviour
                could be affected very easily. However, many components contribute to mental health problems, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</li>
                <li>Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</li>
                <li>Family history of mental health problems</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>What do studies say about self-care and mental health?</strong></h3>
            <p>Self-care relies on expanded self-awareness, which can benefit people who are living with a mental
                illness. Practising self-awareness can help you to recognize patterns in your emotions, including
                events or situations that can cause worsened symptoms. It can also help you to recognize what activities
                are compulsory for your well-being. Most importantly, self-care can help you with how to cope with
                mental illness.</p>
            <p>But that doesn’t mean that self-care is the heal for mental or physical illnesses.</p>
            <p>Many people find it difficult to provide self-care when it is most required. People are quick to
                recurrent the benefits of self-care for depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. But fails to
                recognize the amount of work self-care can need, nor the struggles of people who are trying to provide
                self-care while also living with the symptoms.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Practice self-care to cope with mental illness</strong></h3>
            <p>Your personal label of self-care will depend on what works best for you, what you enjoy, your energy
                levels, personality, and other factors. However, here are some ideas to help you get started on giving
                yourself the attention you deserve.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a quick mental checkup of your body. This might help you a lot to cope with your mental illness.
                    While taking a breath deeply, scan your body, releasing tension as you find it. Check your position
                    and adjust as necessary. It only takes a few seconds to do but can provide change immediately.</li>
                <li>Take care of your health needs. Schedule appointments with your doctor for regular checkups, stay on
                    top of your medications or any other care you need to maintain your physical health.</li>
                <li>Always practice healthy sleep habits and listen to your body’s needs. For example going to bed at an
                    earlier time, making sure that your bedroom is comfortable and quiet before bed can help you enjoy
                    a more restful sleep.</li>
                <li>Make sure to practice healthy eating habits. Eating regularly can help you to feel much better.
                    Eating healthily is obviously a great type of self-care, but so is simply making sure you eat
                    something each day.</li>
                <li>Set aside time to talk with one of your family members or a trusted friend. Read, reflect, journal,
                    or otherwise bemuse with your thoughts. Self-awareness is an important part of self-care, so don’t
                    avoid your emotions!</li>
            </ul>
