            <p>Can’t Sleep? Do you find yourself tossing and turning all night and fatigued 
                during the day? Don’t you feel refreshed when waking up from sleeping, either? 
                It’s probably because when you have insomnia you are never really asleep and 
                you’re never really awake. But you need not stress. There are many ways cognitive 
                behavioral therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) can help you with your sleep problems.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">Defining Insomnia</h2>
            <p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. Individuals with insomnia find it difficult 
                to fall asleep, stay asleep, or both. Chronic insomnia occurs in about 10% of 
                the population. Acute insomnia symptoms occur in about 30-35% of the population.</p>
            <p>Insomnia can occur in isolation or along with other conditions that can include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Psychological difficulties (such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia..)</li>
                <li>Medical conditions (e.g., chronic pain, diabetes, restless leg syndrome..)</li>
                <li>Substance abuse (e.g., cocaine, caffeine, or nicotine)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>People can experience insomnia in distinct ways. Many people experience short-term 
                (acute) insomnia, which lasts for days or weeks.  Some experience long-term 
                (chronic) insomnia that lasts for a month or more. Chronic insomnia is usually a 
                result of traumatic life events or habits that disturb sleep.</p>
            <p>How a person is affected by insomnia varies greatly. It depends on its cause, 
                severity, and how it is influenced by underlying health conditions.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">What are the Potential Causes of Insomnia?</h2>
            <p>There are many potential causes of insomnia. The risk factors include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unhealthy lifestyle, and sleep habits</li>
                <li>Life stressors and Traumatic life events</li>
                <li>Anxiety disorders/ mood disorders and other mental health conditions. 
                    A high number of psychiatric patients also suffer from insomnia. Approximately 
                    50% to 80% of patients with mental illnesses have difficulty with falling or 
                    staying asleep. Research shows that insomnia is strongly associated with 
                    psychiatric disorders. It can be primary or secondary to a mental disorder.</li>
                <li>Medical conditions</li>
                <li>Comorbidity (Fibromyalgia, Diabetes or Arthritis)</li>
                <li>Medication or Substance abuse</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">What are the signs and symptoms of Insomnia?</h2>
            <p>Following are the common signs and symptoms of insomnia.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty falling asleep or waking up at the middle of the night</li>
                <li>Difficulty returning to sleep</li>
                <li>Waking up too early in the morning</li>
                <li>Daytime lethargy and sleepiness</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Mood changes, irritability, and anxiety</li>
                <li>Low on energy or motivation</li>
                <li>Poor concentration and lack of focus</li>
            </ul>      
            <p>Consider speaking with your GP regarding any of the symptoms you experience that 
                might indicate insomnia. They can put you in touch with an Austrian accredited 
                psychologist or psychiatrist. Our psychiatrists and psychologists are experienced 
                in treating insomnia and other sleep disorders. They are here to provide caring, 
                professional support to those in need.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">How is Insomnia diagnosed?</h2>
            <p>Your healthcare provider will conduct a physical exam. He may ask questions to 
                learn more about your sleep difficulties. He will review your sleep history, 
                medical history, and medications.</p>
            <p>You may get a clinical diagnosis if:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You have difficulty falling or staying asleep.</li>
                <li>It has adverse effects on your daily functioning.</li>
                <li>This happens at least three nights a week for 3 months, despite 
                    sufficient opportunity for sleep.</li>
            </ol><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">How can Insomnia affect you?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly, insomnia can have adverse implications on you in terms of 
                    your emotional, mental health. and quality of life.</li>
                <li>Secondly, it impacts your daily functioning.</li>
                <li>Thirdly, it decreases your work productivity.</li>
                <li>Daytime effects including increased risks of accidents.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, it can lead to higher severity of symptoms 
                    in patients with mental disorders.</li>
                <li>In addition, it leads to the development of certain chronic 
                    diseases such as heart diseases and strokes.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">What is CBT-I?</h2>
            <p>CBT-I is a brief, highly effective, and safe behavioral health treatment 
                for patients with chronic and acute insomnia. It is a form of CBT tailored 
                specifically to address insomnia. CBT-I is a collection of skills or 
                techniques that can effectively retrain you to trust your sleep system 
                again. It helps correct any unrealistic thoughts or expectations that 
                you might have around sleep. The thoughts that end up putting extra 
                pressure on you. For example,’ I must get this many hours of sleep’. 
                Hence, it makes sleep more difficult.</p>
            <p>CBT-I typically involves 4 to 12 customized sessions. 
                Patients are encouraged to modify their beliefs about insomnia.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">Is CBT an Evidence-based Treatment for Insomnia?</h2>
            <h4>Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is an effective treatment and can
                be given in a primary care setting by psychologists.</h4>
            <h4>It is proposed that Cognitive behavioral therapy should be the first-line 
                treatment for adults having chronic insomnia (American College of Physician ACP, 2016).</h4>
            <h4>Research also suggests that there is a good deal of evidence for applying CBT 
                as an initial treatment for chronic insomnia.</h4>
            <p>Likewise, a comparative meta-analysis of 21 studies showed similar short-term outcomes for 
                CBT and pharmacotherapy. While CBT produced greater long-term benefits.</p>
            <p><strong>Clinical guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of 
                Chronic Insomnia in Adults also suggest that :</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>CBT is effective and recommended in the treatment of primary and secondary insomnia.</li>
                <li>This treatment is effective for adults of all ages including older adults.</li>
                <li>It should be utilized as an initial treatment when appropriate and 
                    when conditions permit.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-8">CBT-I vs Pharmacotherapy</h2>
            <p>Usually, people with chronic insomnia reach out to doctors for drug therapies that 
                have serious side effects. CBT is likely to have very fewer side effects as compared 
                to sleep medications. FDA only approves sleep medications for short-term use, ideally 
                no longer than four to five weeks. This explains the paramount role of applying CBT 
                in practice.</p>
            <p> Skills learned in CBT provide long-term effectiveness. But, there is a degree of 
                effort and self-discipline needed to commit to therapy as it is far more challenging 
                than taking a pill. It offers many advantages over present-day pharmacotherapies. 
                That’s not to say there’s never a place or time for sleep medications.</p>
            <p>When CBT-I alone is not successful in improving the symptoms, it is 
                recommended to go for sleep medications alongside CBT-I.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-9">Does CBT Work for Insomnia?</h2><br>
            <h3><strong>CBT-I works because it addresses the cause that drives insomnia</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>According to conferences on the management of chronic insomnia, CBT is 
                    equally successful as drugs for treating chronic insomnia in the short run.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, a Harvard Medical School study found that CBT was more 
                    beneficial than sleep medicine in treating chronic insomnia.</li>
                <li>The beneficial effects of CBT may last well beyond the termination of active 
                    treatment than drugs.</li>
                <li>CBT-I leads to increased daytime functioning as well as greater sleep 
                    quality with persistence.</li>
                <li>CBT-I improves the lives of 70% to 80% of people who suffer from primary insomnia.</li>
                <li>Less time to fall asleep, more time spent asleep, and waking up less 
                    during sleep are all benefits.</li>
                <li>Patients learn useful sleep routines that they can use if insomnia strikes again.</li>
                <li>It also has a number of advantages over medications in terms of safety, efficacy and 
                    durability. Pharmacological treatments for insomnia, on the other hand, have been 
                    linked to tolerance, reliance, and negative side effects.</li>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-10">What are the Core Components of CBT-I?</h2>
            <p>CBT-I is a multicomponent treatment because it combines several different approaches. 
                Sessions may include cognitive, behavioral, and educational components</p>
            <p><strong>Cognitive Treatments:</strong>The cognitive part of CBT-I involves reframing 
                unhelpful thoughts and feelings around sleep. As a result, overtime it reduces any sleep 
                related worries.</p>
            <p><strong>Behavioral Treatments:</strong> The behavioral component of CBT-I helps you 
                identify and address any behaviors that may be perpetuating or worsening 
                your sleep problems.</p>
            <p>CBT for insomnia consists of five distinct components that work together 
                to alter a patient’s sleep-related beliefs and behaviors, as well as 
                their sleep environment</p>
            <p>In terms of how these components are implemented, all practitioners generally follow 
                a similar pattern, although they can be somewhat changed to meet your own needs. 
                The following are the essential elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sleep education/ Understanding Sleep</li>
                <li>Cognitive therapy/ Changing dysfunctional 
                    thinking patterns, beliefs and attitudes that interfere with sleep</li>
                <li>Sleep restriction</li>
                <li>Stimulus control</li>
                <li>Relaxation Training</li>
                <li>Sleep hygiene</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Sleep Education:</strong></h3>
            <p>CBT-I includes several educational treatments aimed at improving 
                sleep quality. A therapist may educate a client about</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What a good sleep is</li>
                <li>What sleep is not</li>
                <li>Sleep cycle</li>
                <li>4 stages of sleep NI, N2, N3 and REM</li>
                <li>Sleep quality vs quantity</li>
                <li>Healthy sleep-related behaviors</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Cognitive therapy</strong></h3>
            <p>Cognitive therapy uses cognitive restructuring to 
                target problematic beliefs and attitudes about sleep. 
                For instance, needing 8 hours each night or napping to 
                catch up on sleep loss. It builds up sleep anxiety 
                for you, if you believe you should be sleeping in a 
                certain way or that some part of your sleep is not 
                normal when it quite is.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you can also keep a sleep diary or a 
                sleep log to have an overview of where you currently 
                are in regards to your sleep. It helps you see your 
                progress.</p>
            <p><strong>Sleep restriction:</strong></p>
            <blockquote>I sometimes suffer from Insomnia, and when 
                I can’t fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game <br><br>
                <cite>Roz Chast</cite>
            </blockquote><br>
            <p>Sleep restriction is not about restricting sleep, it’s 
                all about sleep efficacy and restricting time in bed. 
                Many persons who suffer from chronic insomnia report 
                sleeping for an average of four hours per night. The 
                rest of the hours are spent tossing and turning in bed. 
                Also, they are spent feeling anxious, worried, and 
                frustrated. Sleep restriction is about reducing this 
                sleep window.</p>
            <p>The goal here is to consolidate sleep. Instead of 
                spreading out tiny little snippets of sleep over a 
                very long sleep, you get nice, strong, deeper, and 
                more restorative sleep. It helps create 
                and strengthen the association between bed 
                and sleep.</p>
            <p>People with insomnia associate bed with being awake 
                and anxious. With bedtime restriction, you spend 
                all your time in bed asleep. It retrains you to see 
                the bed as time for sleep.</p>
            <h3><strong>Stimulus Control</strong></h3>
            <p>Stimulus control helps to associate bed with sleep and 
                nothing else. Ongoing insomnia creates a negative 
                learned association between bedtime and sleep. Stimulus 
                control eliminates this association between bedtime and 
                arousal. The technique ensures that you are not doing 
                any activity in bed apart from sleep. Some habits 
                include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with your bed time routine</li>
                <li>Only go to bed when sleepy</li>
                <li>Get up if not asleep in 20-30 minutes</li>
                <li>Do some relaxing, enjoyable activity</li>
                <li>Go to bed again when sleepy</li>
                <li>Wake up same time, no naps</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Relaxation Training:</strong></h3>
            <p>Above all, CBT-I also includes some kind of relaxation 
                component. CBT-I therapists also suggest many 
                relaxation techniques. The goal of relaxation 
                techniques is not falling asleep, but the relaxation 
                of mind and body.</p>
            <p>This facilitates sleep and decreases physiological 
                and cognitive arousal. The hour before sleep can be 
                for relaxing and doing enjoyable activities.  </p>
            <p>Here are a few relaxation techniques commonly taught 
                in CBT-I that serve as ways to elicit the relaxation 
                response and help fall asleep:</p>
            <h3><strong>Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR):</strong></h3>
            <p>PMR is a deep relaxation technique that involves 
                tensing and relaxing different muscle groups one by 
                one. This helps reduce muscle tension that leads to 
                sound sleep.</p>
            <h3><strong>Deep Breathing and Visualization Exercises:</strong></h3>
            <p>Another way to engage the body’s natural relaxation 
                response is through deep breathing and visualization 
                exercises. Deep breathing exercises are also helpful 
                tools have that can calm your mind.</p>
            <p>These exercises involve taking slow deep breaths and 
                rely on using mental images to create a sense of 
                well-being in the body. This reduces stress and 
                transition you to sleep.</p>
            <p>Underlying stress and anxiety often result in 
                insomnia. These simple exercises can help relieve 
                the stress and tension that is stored in the body.</p>
            <h3><strong>Hypnosis:</strong></h3>
            <p>Hypnosis is a useful tool for enhancing sleep. 
                In a deep hypnotic state, your subconscious is 
                receptive to thoughts and ideas. During hypnosis, 
                you can verbally repeat or listen to a relaxing 
                thought such as ‘I fall asleep as soon as I lie in 
                my bed’ or ‘I am relaxed and calm’.</p>
            <h3><strong>Mindfulness Meditation:</strong></h3>
            <p>Mindfulness meditation is about focusing on the 
                present moment. It increases awareness of your 
                breathing and body and makes you more conscious.</p>
            <p>If a thought or emotion pops up during meditation, you 
                just have to observe it without judgment, always 
                returning the focus to your body and breath.</p>
            <p>Additionally, guided and body scan meditations can 
                also be of great help for insomnia. The act of 
                focusing and increased awareness promotes relaxation, 
                which helps you sleep.</p>
            <h3><strong>Biofeedback:</strong></h3>
            <p>Biofeedback teaches you to identify and master your 
                body’s stress response. It can also use sensors 
                to measure your physiological health such as heart 
                rate, breathing, and muscle tension.</p><br>
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-11">Sleep hygiene:</h2>
            <p>Strong sleep hygiene means having both a bedroom 
                environment and daily routines that promote consistent, 
                uninterrupted sleep. Following are some sleep 
                hygiene rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce time in bed</li>
                <li>Using bed only for sex and sleep</li>
                <li>Keep a regular sleep schedule</li>
                <li>Erase the bedroom clock</li>
                <li>Exercise in the afternoon/ early evening</li>
                <li>Avoid caffeine, nicotine and alcohol</li>
                <li>Limit your room light and screen time as 
                    they can also affect your sleep drive and 
                    circadian rhythms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Educating clients about the importance of good 
                sleep hygiene is a core component of CBT-I. 
                However, it is not an effective stand-alone 
                treatment for insomnia.</p>
            <p>Hence, CBT-I coaches engage patients to be active 
                participants in their sleep health. They teach 
                cognitive and behavioral skills that resolve 
                chronic insomnia in 70% to 80% of patients 
                often without medication.</p>
            <h3><strong>Who Provides CBT-I?</strong></h3>
            <p>CBT-I is often provided by a counselor, therapist, 
                doctor, or psychiatrist trained in this form of 
                treatment. Unfortunately, there aren’t enough CBT-I 
                coaches despite the widespread call for its demand. 
                To respond to this widespread call digital CBT-1 
                (DCBT-I) offers the benefits of CBT-I to a far and 
                wider audience and is also as effective.</p>
            <h3><strong>How long does CBT take to work for insomnia?</strong></h3>
            <p>CBT for insomnia involves anywhere between 4 to 12 
                weekly 1-hour sessions by a qualified sleep 
                therapist. The length of therapy also depends 
                on the severity of your sleep disorder.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-12">Does CBT-I have any Risks?</h2>
            <p>The risks of CBT are likely to be mild, but they 
                may be uncomfortable at times.  Although this 
                treatment has demonstrated great efficacy in 
                treating insomnia, it does require a degree of 
                effort and self-discipline needed to commit to 
                therapy.</p>
            <p>Talking about painful experiences, thoughts, 
                and feelings can be challenging and may cause 
                temporary stress and discomfort.</p>
            <p>Working with practitioners with experience in CBT-I 
                can help manage the discomfort and challenges. 
                Above all, it can take some time to learn and 
                practice the skills.</p><br>
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-13">A Piece of Advice:</h2>
            <p>CBT is a fantastic long-term solution for insomnia. 
                It is a collection of skills and techniques and if 
                you learn them, they are with you for life. It is 
                not an ongoing prescription for the rest of your 
                life with sleeping pills. Anytime, if your sleep 
                gets disturbed again in the future, you remember 
                all the skills that you’ve learned. You can 
                reintroduce those skills into your routine to get 
                your sleep back on track. As it is rightly 
                said that:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Sleep is the best meditation <br><br>
                <cite>Dalai Lama</cite>
            </blockquote><br>
            <p>It is highly encouraged to look into CBT-I as an 
                initial treatment for insomnia. Usually, patients 
                with insomnia do not view it as a clinically 
                significant disorder that warrants medical attention. 
                Anyone who experiences ongoing trouble sleeping and 
                feels that is affecting his/her daily functioning 
                should see a professional.</p>
            <p>Contact our friendly coordination team to book an 
                appointment with one of our clinicians if you are 
                suffering from any sleep disorder. You can reach
