            <p>Jon Kabat-Zinn established mindfulness as a tool for therapy in the late 
                1970s at the University of Massachusetts Medical Centre’s Stress Reduction 
                Clinic. That program was very successful. Thus, it gave the push for MBCT 
                to become a renowned treatment. It was first developed as a group skill 
                training session. It aimed at the episodes between depression attacks. 
                MBCT addressed the vulnerability of this major issue. MBCT is also a 
                part of CBT.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">Defining Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy – MBCT</h2>
            <p>MBCT plays a major role in those who are struggling not to relapse into 
                depression. How we think, and deal with our ups and downs, gives 
                reality to who we are. Whether we like it or not, our reactions and 
                our thinking are what makes us. However, this can be very confusing. 
                Especially, if we have to go through what we don’t want to. Having to 
                make a bunch of decisions that we would not have if we had the choice. 
                The impact on one’s mental health when put under stress is never the 
                best. That is where MBCT becomes important.</p>
            <p>Combining mental health with every small action of day-to-day life to 
                improve the overall quality of life is the main goal of mindfulness-based 
                cognitive therapy. It is a part of psychotherapy. MBCT also holds an 
                aspect of cognitive therapy. It is a combination of behavioural techniques, 
                guided by mindful strategies. These lead an individual to understand and 
                dive deep into themselves. Thus they cope with their mental health in 
                healthier and soothing ways.</p>
            <p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is mostly used to bring solace to those 
                who suffer from depression. These techniques incorporate mindful activities, 
                that are simple and very easy to follow. These techniques and practices 
                help an individual free themselves from feeling helpless and lonely. In 
                other words, depression. Practising these soulful methods as soon as one 
                realizes they need help, will be a practical way of fighting depression 
                before it consumes an individual and severely impacts their lives. By 
                recognizing and giving colour to what we deal with in ourselves every 
                day, the battle becomes easy to fight.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy vs. Cognitive 
                Behavioral Therapy(CBT)</h2>
            <p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a part of cognitive behavioural therapy.</p>
            <p>Cognitive-behavioural therapy is an attempt in turning negative feelings into 
                positive ones. A CBT professional will help an individual understand what is 
                bothering them. They will guide them through a process that will help them turn 
                their troublesome thoughts into positive ones. CBT is based on the understanding 
                that our emotions are reactions to our thoughts. Thus, CBT focuses on attending 
                to the thoughts that create a negative impact on an individual.</p>
            <p>Similarly, MBCT deals with our thoughts and emotions as well. However, 
                the process followed by MBCT professionals is slightly different. In 
                MBCT, an individual is taught to alienate themselves from the process 
                of thinking. To take a break from challenging themselves by trying to 
                change their way of thinking. In other words, an individual is taught 
                to distance themselves from what bothers them. This is to identify 
                their impact to treat it without judgment.</p>
            <p>This process is meant to break off the stress that happens by challenging 
                one’s thoughts. As mentioned earlier, MBCT is mostly used on depressed 
                individuals. It is likely to give them a new approach to life. That is 
                by helping them find a way to deal with their emotions. The understanding 
                of it being okay to not be able to overpower these negative thoughts are 
                likely to ease someone. Especially someone who is trying very hard to 
                rise above them. It is indeed a much-needed break for a tired mind.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">Techniques of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy</h2>
            <p>MBCT is completely built on being mindful. Thus, all its techniques are 
                decided in a way that affects the mind. The most important direction 
                is to learn and understand their thoughts without judging them. It is 
                okay to feel a certain way. But why do you feel so? How strongly do you 
                feel?</p>
            <p>Below are a few techniques used in MBCT.</p><br>
            
            <h3><strong>Body scan method</strong></h3>
            <p>Individuals begin the Body Scan exercise by lying down on their backs 
                with their palms facing up and their feet slightly apart. Sitting on a 
                comfortable chair with their feet on the floor works too. Then, they 
                lie quite motionless for the length of the exercise. If they need to 
                change their posture, they do it intentionally and with awareness.</p>
            <p>The MBCT professional that guides this exercise then leads the group 
                through the Body Scan. It starts with bringing awareness to the breath. 
                Noticing the rhythm and experience of breathing in and out. He/she then 
                advises that participants should not strive to change their breathing 
                patterns; instead, they should simply maintain a calm awareness of 
                their breathing.</p>
            <p>Next, the guide focuses on the body. How it feels, the texture of clothing 
                against the skin, the shapes of the surface on which the body is lying, 
                and the body’s and environment’s temperatures. The participants are then 
                told to focus their attention on any regions of their bodies that are 
                tingling, painful, or feel unusually heavy or light. The facilitator 
                instructs the participants to make a list of any places of their body 
                where they have no sensations or are more sensitive.</p>
            <p>A body scan follows a typical order. The MBCT professional that 
                guides you through the process will inform you.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Mindfulness in daily activities for MBCT</strong></h3>
            <p>This method refers to being mindful even while engaging in the most 
                insignificant activities. Simple activities can sometimes be the most 
                beneficial. This is especially true in the case of MBCT.</p>
            <p>This can refer to the below practices.</p>

            <h4><strong>Mindful eating for MBCT</strong></h4>
            <p>Turning your whole attention to whatever you’re eating is what mindful 
                eating is all about. Turn off any distractions including the Internet, 
                TV, radio, and smartphone. Allow all of your senses to focus on the task 
                of eating.</p>
            <h4><strong>Mindful bathing for MBCT</strong></h4>
            <p>This is a simple exercise for beginners. Pay attention to the temperature 
                of the water as it strikes your body. The feel of the spray, the smell 
                of the shampoo, and the sensation of lathering soap against your skin 
                when showering. If your mind wanders during your shower, which as usual, 
                gradually draw it back to the present. Think about what you see, hear, 
                and smell.</p>
            <h4><strong>Mindful kitchen work for MBCT</strong></h4>
            <p>You can especially try being mindful when you are washing dishes.</p>
            <p>When you simply have a few dishes to wash, try this exercise.</p>
            <p>Keep an eye on the filthy dishes while you scrape or sponge them. 
                Take note of the textures, images, and noises associated with dishwashing. 
                You can even concentrate on the smell. However, whether or not this 
                is a good idea is debatable.</p>
            <h4><strong>Mindful exercise for MBCT</strong></h4>
            <p>As previously mentioned, mindful exercising is an excellent method to 
                involve mindfulness for a healthy lifestyle. Turn off the television 
                and the music, and say your goodbyes to friends and family for a few 
                minutes. Concentrate your attention on how your muscles feel, how you 
                move, and the rate at which your breath changes.</p>
            <p>Allow yourself to really enjoy the benefits of exercising without the 
                distractions of discomfort or heavy breathing, which we are all too 
                familiar with.</p>
            <h4><strong>Mindful stretching for MBCT</strong></h4>
            <p>Mindfulness takes place in a variety of settings throughout the day. 
                This is including during physical activity.</p>
            <p>Rushing to the workout, on the other hand, can be a 
                lost opportunity to mentally and physically prepare for physical exertion.</p>
            <p>Stretching before a workout is beneficial for a variety of reasons, 
                including the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For humans, it’s a natural and instinctual movement.</li>
                <li>Stretching on a regular basis improves flexibility and</li>
                <li>Enhances the range of motion.</li>
                <li>By sending a surge of oxygen to the muscles, stretching 
                    improves and enhances circulation.</li>
                <li>Stretching is enjoyable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are a few types of mindful stretching that you can involve 
                yourself in, such as Yoga and Pandiculation.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Three-minute breathing</strong></h3>
            <p>The three-minute breathing space is a simple practice that 
                may be completed in three simple steps:</p>
            <p>The first minute is spent answering the question, “How am I 
                doing right now?”. That is while focusing on the feelings, thoughts, 
                and sensations that occur. Attempt to assign words and phrases to 
                these feelings, ideas, and experiences.</p>
            <p>The second minute is to maintain breath awareness. The final minute is to 
                shift the focus of attention away from the breath and toward bodily 
                sensations. Think of when and how they affect the rest of the body.</p>
            <p>Practising mindfulness whenever the opportunity arises will help you 
                maintain a healthy sense of awareness and balance throughout your day.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">How does MBCT work?</h2>
            <p>MBCT program is 8 weeks long. It is based on allowing participants to explore 
                their mindset. This includes understanding the causes of depression and also 
                relapses. By being aware of how the mind works, they have the ability to 
                remove themselves from what depresses them. It is almost an out-of-body 
                approach. The goal is to identify the problems and solve them without 
                judging oneself. This method has been found to be successful in depression 
                patients for exactly this reason. By being able to see what causes their 
                mood swings, they gain an understanding of how best to deal with them.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">Importance of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy</h2>
            <p>MBCT has been shown to be successful in treating those who have had episodes 
                of depression. While it was created to treat depression, it has also been 
                proved to be useful for a variety of other applications, such as anxiety, 
                bipolar disorder, mood swings, general unhappiness, and most importantly 
                to prevent relapses of formerly depressed persons.</p>
            <p>People can learn how to use mindfulness meditation. That is to stop the 
                automatic processes that lead to depression. During a depressive episode, 
                low mood, negative thoughts, and certain bodily feelings such as 
                exhaustion are common. Even after the incident has passed, links 
                between the many symptoms may still exist. A tiny negative stimulus 
                might set off a massive relapse. Researchers discovered that when 
                people with a history of depression are down, they are more likely 
                to have negative memories and thoughts from the past. This can lead 
                to anxiety about the future.</p>
            <p>CBT is based on the idea that thoughts come before moods and that incorrect 
                self-beliefs contribute to negative feelings like depression. MBCT uses 
                components of cognitive therapy to help you detect and review disturbing 
                thought patterns and replace them with more realistic positive ones. 
                This method allows people to reflect on their thoughts. Living in the 
                past or the future does little good. MBCT promotes clarity of thinking 
                and equips you with the tools you need to let go of negative thoughts. 
                This stops allowing them to feed your despair. MBCT, like cognitive 
                therapy, is based on the idea that if you have a history of depression 
                and feel upset. You will likely resort to the habitual cognitive 
                processes that started a previous depressive episode.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">Is MBCT for you?</h2>
            <p>MBCT therapy can be especially useful for those who are,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>suffering from depression or chronic anxiety</li>
                <li>suffered from depression and may relapse</li>
                <li>advised to continue antidepressant medicine</li>
                <li>experiencing bipolar disorder</li>
                <li>having frequent mood swings</li>
                <li>interested in learning about stress, depression to avoid them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You don’t have to have depression to seek MBCT. One can always reach out 
                to a <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/clinicians/">professional</a> 
                before things get bad. Learning about these issues and
                 practising mindfulness will pave the way to increasing the 
                 quality of life.</p>
            <p>However, it may not be the best idea to attend an MBCT program while 
                experiencing severe depression symptoms. Best to wait it out, until 
                better enough to focus on improvement. The general negative mood may 
                easily lead these patients to give up on MBCT. While MBCT is one of 
                the most effective treatment methods, giving up on it when one is not 
                ready for help may lose out on an amazing opportunity.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">Concerns regarding MBCT</h2>
            <p>As with every other medical approach, MBCT has its own concerns and limitations.</p>
            <p>The effectiveness of MBCT is supported by a large body of evidence. It has 
                generally produced favourable benefits for persons in treatment, according 
                to the study. However, because this is a new therapeutic option, the 
                long-term benefits of this technique may not yet be fully understood.</p>
            <p>However, research on the success of MCBT for active or severe depression is still 
                underway, so discuss your symptoms with your doctor to see if this method is 
                right for you.</p>
            <p>The classroom component of MBCT is important. However, much of the work is 
                completed outside of class.</p>
            <p>Participants get homework to complete. These include listening to recorded 
                guided meditations and practising mindfulness in their daily lives. This 
                could entail using MBCT skills like cleaning your teeth, showering, 
                washing the dishes, exercising, or making your bed to everyday activities 
                like brushing your teeth, bathing, washing the dishes, exercising, or 
                making your bed.</p>
