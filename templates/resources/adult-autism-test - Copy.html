                In fact, the DSM-5 or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
                created by the American Psychiatric Association explains that the onset of
                the disorder is in the early developmental stages. Most children show
                symptoms of autism by 12-18 months of age or earlier. Nonetheless, the
                disorder can be hidden away inside you. Let us explain. The DSM-5
                further indicates that symptoms of autism may take time to fully manifest.
                Consequently, adults starting to show autistic symptoms or being tested
                and diagnosed with autism is not unlikely at all.</p>
            <p>If you are an adult who suddenly started to show symptoms of autism or
                know someone who did, it’s not because of a sudden development in the
                disorder. It’s because the condition was already there but the symptoms
                were subtle. Alternatively, you may even have been misdiagnosed when
                you were a child. Yes, that is possible. For instance, have been a lot
                of cases where autism was misdiagnosed as ADHD (Attention Deficit
                Hyperactivity Disorder) because of similarities in symptoms.</p>
            <p>Now to the central point of this article: getting tested for autism
                as an adult. Testing autism in adults is far more complicated than
                children’s tests. Most medical professionals who do autism diagnoses
                are used to seeing children and are not really trained to diagnose
                adults. Furthermore, we still don’t know much about how adult autism
                differs from the children’s variant. Keep on reading to find out how
                testing is done and how a diagnosis is made.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">Prevalence</h2>
            <p>With respect to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 164000
                Australians living with Autism in 2015 which is a 42.1% increase from the
                2012 numbers. The prevalence of autism in men was higher than that of
                women, with every 4 out of 5 from the total number of cases being males.
                While no statistics on the number of adults with autism have been indicated,
                it is said that 3/4 of the total number were young. Hence, we could assume
                that 41000 of these cases were adults. These numbers would have (obviously)
                increased by now.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">What is autism?</h2>
            <p>
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or simply, autism is a complex developmental condition that is characterized
                by changes in social interactions, speech, and nonverbal behaviour, and restricted or repetitive behaviour.
                The complex part of autism comes from its many subtypes. Depending on these symptoms and severity are
                different in each person. In fact, when it comes to children, no two children show symptoms the same way. For
                instance, a child diagnosed with autism may have difficulty learning and show signs of lower intelligence
                whereas another would show high intelligence but have trouble communicating and behaving appropriately in
                social settings. Consequently, this is one of the reasons why the APA (American Psychological Disorder)
                modified the diagnostic name of autism in the DSM-5 to “Autism Spectrum Disorder” instead of the previously
                used sub diagnoses such as Autistic Disorder and Asperger Syndrome.
            </p>
            <img src="../../images/adult-autism.webp" alt="no-img"> <br>
            <p>
                As mentioned early, the disorder begins really early in life and eventually starts disrupting normal social
                functioning in social settings such as schools and workplaces. Most children with autism show symptoms in
                their first year. However, a small percentage of children show normal development in the first year and then
                go through a period of regression between 18 to 24 months where they develop symptoms.

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">How does family therapy help?</h2>
            <p>Family therapy is specifically designed to address things that affect the
                health and function of a family. It views individual problems in a larger
                context. It is based on the theory that individual problems can not be
                solved without understanding where it is coming from. So, the dynamics of
                the family setting are analyzed. This is because the function of the
                family influences the problems. Unresolved issues may cripple your family
                members day to day lives. You may notice them visibly losing interest,
                being backward, or being very lazy.</p>
            <p>Most of what is used in family therapy are adopted using cognitive therapy,
                interpersonal therapy, and behaviour therapy. Just like each of these, the
                problem and solution vary on the individual. When you feel like the issues
                in your family are too big for you to handle you can trust family therapists
                to help you out.</p><br>

                There is no shame in trying to fix your home. It is always better to act before it
                is too late.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">Techniques used in family therapy</h2>
            <p>It is up to your therapist to decide the most useful type of family therapy
                to help your family. Of course, it is important that you take this advice
                and guidance from a therapist you feel comfortable with. Here is a listing
                of some of the most used methods during family therapy.</p>
            <h4><strong>Structural method</strong></h4>
            <p>This technique focuses on strengthening the internal family bonds. The set
                adjustments leave parents in control. I also press on the boundaries when
                it comes to both parents and children. The therapist is likely to take an
                intimate initiative to observe the process of therapy. This theory believes
                that family issues are caused because of the faulty structure of the family.
                As a common fix, parents are requested to be more assertive.</p>
            <h4><strong>Bowenian method</strong></h4>
            <p>This technique is focusing on a single family member. In other words, this
                individual is likely to seek therapy alone. They may want to vent to a third
                party on what is happening and will seek help alone. However, he or she may
                interact with a single family member at a time to fix things. The individual
                will receive instructions on how to be less emotionally reactive in the family.</p>
            <h4><strong>Systemic family therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>This therapy method focuses on identifying hidden languages behind a member’s
                behaviour. However, the therapist takes a distant stand, evaluating as the
                family members dive into their issues. Altering one person’s actions can
                affect the entire family. The therapist will direct circular questions to
                be out the different perspectives of the family members. In return, they
                can shift their actions.</p>
            <h4><strong>Narrative family therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>This therapy method encourages individuals to navigate through life using
                their own skillset. This helps individuals help themselves during problems
                they face in their lives. Especially the insignificant ones. The therapist
                will help the narrator by guiding him/her through issues and helping him/her
                clarify things.</p>
            <h4><strong>Communication family therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>Communication concerns are an important need in therapy. Particularly when
                it comes to relationship treatment. When the primary difficulty between the
                couple is a lack of communication. Differences in cultural origins and/or
                personal experiences might lead to communication problems between people.
                In other words, trauma, secrecy, and mental health concerns are some of the
                other factors that might lead to this problem. However, there are various
                solutions for dealing with communication challenges. They can be for the
                benefit of an individual or two people in a close relationship. However, a
                qualified therapist can help a person in deciding the most effective ways
                for increasing communication. A few examples are active listening, opening
                lines of communication, and mediated communication.</p>
            <h4><strong>Transgenerational family therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>This method allows therapists to look at relations between family members
                from different generations. In other words, the observations and analysis
                of interactions by the family therapist aid them in grasping the core
                concerns inside the family group. The therapist may pick up on future
                challenges or stressful situations in addition to existing issues.
                This therapy concept frequently combined with different therapies.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">What are the advantages of family therapy?</h2>
            <p>On a personal level, each person deals with challenges in their own unique
                way. However, that is with differing levels of difficulty. Outside help in
                the form of therapy or counselling can be quite beneficial in addressing
                these concerns. Similarly, there are situations when the issues are not
                caused by an individual. In other words, they are caused by or chaotic
                familial relationships.</p>
            <p>Familial intervention is the best way to address these types of issues. It
                is a strategy of enhancing communications and relationships among the family
                members involved.</p>
            <p>Every member of the family is involved in family therapy. That is to discover
                the source of discomfort and eliminate it in the best way possible.
                Similarly, parents, siblings, maternal or paternal cousins, uncles,
                aunts, and even grandparents may be involved.</p>
            <p>Family therapy is a group counselling method that benefits the entire
                family. The following are some of the benefits of family counselling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying family members’ sources of conflict and anxiety</li>
                <li>Family members must re-establish communication.</li>
                <li>More effective expression of painful feelings</li>
                <li>Understanding and respecting other family members’ points of view and opinions</li>
                <li>Allowing family members to value the wants and needs of one another</li>
                <li>assisting people with the stresses of difficult situations</li>
                <li>Developing a stronger sense of empathy for one another</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal of family therapy is to bring the family back into harmony. However,
                it is critical that family members enter the process with an open mind and a
                willingness to address the issues that are affecting the family. That is
                necessary for the procedure to be effective. The family can then completely
                benefit from everything that family therapy has to offer.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">Is your family eligible for therapy?</h2>
            <p>To avoid tense interactions during a family therapy session, individual
                counselling for one or more family members may be recommended. Some families
                are not thought to be good candidates for family therapy.
                They are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Those with cultural or religious values that oppose or distrust counselling</li>
                <li>Families in which one or both parents are psychotic</li>
                <li>The families whose members are unable or unwilling to meet for treatment
                    on a regular basis
                </li>
                <li>Families with members who are unable to attend therapy sessions due
                    to physical illness or other restrictions
                </li>
                <li>Members of families with inflexible personality structures</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-8">Potential risks of family therapy</h2>
            <p>The most significant risk in family therapy is the ability to upset already
                bad relationships. Family therapy brings out a lot of hidden feelings.
                However, not everyone can handle all that. Similarly, intensive family
                therapy can be tough for family members who have been diagnosed with mental
                illnesses. For children who may not fully comprehend the relationships that
                occur during family therapy, family therapy can be very tough and stressful.
                Individual treatment for children and adolescents, either by the same
                therapist (if suitable) or a therapist who is aware of the family treatment,
                might be beneficial.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-9">How can you find a family therapist?</h2>
            <p>Is it time to seek professional help for your family? Here is how you can
                find the best therapist to help you out.</p>
            <h4><strong>Ask a doctor</strong></h4>
            <p>Patients can often be referred to a qualified family therapy service by their
                family doctors. Thus, family doctors typically provide insight into which
                family therapists in the area might offer the best treatment for a family.
                They have worked with other families with similar challenges. Thus,
                consider seeking advice from your
                <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/clinicians/">doctor</a>.</p>
            <h4><strong>Ask a religious leader</strong></h4><br>
            <p>If you belong to a religious community, you can seek advice from your
                religious head. Families with strong religious background are more likely
                to choose a counsellor who shares their beliefs.</p>
            <h3><strong>Refer online information or personal recommendations</strong></h3>
            <p>People who have benefited from a therapist’s
                <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/contact-us/">services</a> are one of the best
                sources for referrals. Inquire about a family member’s experience with their
                therapist, if you know someone who has gone to counselling. After that,
                learn about the therapist’s communication style. Also of the precise actions
                that he or she advised your buddy to do.</p>
            <p>On top of that, you have the right to inquire about your therapist’s
                qualifications before you leave the responsibility of your family on
                their hands. Here are a few questions you can ask your therapists.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What university did you attend to earn your professional degrees?</li>
                <li>Who was in charge of your early clinical years?</li>
                <li>How long have you been working in this field?</li>
                <li>What is your experience treating a condition like mine?</li>
                <li>Is your bachelor’s degree in family therapy or a comparable field?</li>
                <li>What are your thoughts on family counselling from a philosophical
                    standpoint? Within family therapy, there are various schools of
                    thought, and you should find out how the therapist you’re considering
                    views families and what tactics they employ.
