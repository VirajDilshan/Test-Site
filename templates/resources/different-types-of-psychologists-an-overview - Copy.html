            <p>Psychology is a term we all know. In its most basic term, it is the scientific 
                study of mind and behaviour. Psychologists on the other hand are the brain 
                behind the work. They are responsible for determining what is bothering you, 
                how best they can be of help, and for making sure their clients get to the 
                goal they are working for. Not to mention, the faith psychologists should 
                have in the progression of their client’s mental health. There are different 
                types of psychologists, overseeing different dimensions. It ranges from 
                sit-down conversations on sofas to conducting other complicated tests.</p>
            <p>Based on what they are good at, and which field they can perform best, there are 
                many different types of psychologists. This is also because these professionals 
                themselves may or may not possess a specific skill set that is needed to be good 
                in a different psychologist arena.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">Who is a Psychologist?</h2>
            <p>A psychologist is a professional who specializes in the study of the brain 
                and behaviour. When people hear the word psychologist, they tend to think 
                of talk therapy. However, this profession actually spans a broad array of 
                specialties. This involves clinical trials and strategic management. A 
                psychologist uses scientific information to help individuals understand, 
                explain, and modify their behaviour. To do this, they study how humans 
                think, their emotions, and conduct. People who are referred to as psychologists 
                include those who solve mental difficulties. This includes treating mental 
                diseases, use psychological knowledge, and study as well as those who conduct 
                psychological research and teach at colleges or universities as 
                social scientists.</p>
            <p>Psychologists research how people operate and interact with what is around them. 
                Some psychologists have devised methods to aid in the slowing of global warming. 
                A list of some of the specialty areas and related tasks is provided below.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">Types of psychologists</h2>
            <h3><strong>Health Psychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>When it comes to different types of psychologists, this field tries to encourage 
                good health behaviours while reducing bad ones. That is such as poor eating habits, 
                cigarettes, drug abuse, and not having enough exercise. Its goal is to lower the 
                risk of chronic illnesses like weight gain, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, 
                tumours, and traumas. They work with other medical professionals to provide 
                advice on attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours. These things contribute to illness, 
                and how to modify them. They develop public health plans in areas such as exercise, 
                alcohol, smoking, and drug usage, injury, and disease management. By evaluating the 
                extent of illnesses, health behaviour, and other variables, health psychologists 
                collaborate with local residents and other experts to improve health and wellbeing.</p>
            <p>They produce and take up plans that can improve human lives and well-being. 
                This includes medications to assist them to cope with disease or other issues. 
                They also dedicate themselves to understand the effect of mentality on the physical 
                system of a person. They can also notice underlying factors of people when it comes 
                to their attitude that can put them at risk. In other words, they are skilled in 
                being able to treat the mental impact of the illness.</p><br>

           <h3><strong>BioPsychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>Another important part of types of psychologists is this. Biological psychologists 
                investigate and do neurological and psychology studies. They can learn about 
                diverse biological variables that influence how we think, feel, and behave 
                by studying the brain function of action. This sort of psychologist may also 
                look at how brain damage and disease affect behaviour. Investigators can 
                discover novel ways to prevent, cure, and manage brain disorders and trauma 
                by better understanding how individuals are impacted by such injuries 
                and diseases.</p>
            <p>Things that are in their profile are,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigating human responsiveness concerns</li>
                <li>Performing animal and human research in order to find ways to promote 
                    health and well-being.</li>
                <li>Directing research projects involving cognitive processes</li>
                <li>Investigating the effect of brain trauma and disorders</li>
                <li>Examining the relationship between mood swings and a variety 
                    of mental illnesses</li>
                <li>Sensations that might cause mental discomfort are being studied</li>
                <li>Working as a teacher at colleges and universities</li>
                <li>Undertaking experiments on animals to determine the impact of 
                    medicines on behaviour</li>
                <li>Performing duties efficiently in a fast pace environment</li>
            </ul>    
            <h3><strong>Clinical Psychologists -Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>Clinical psychologists are also a key element in the types of psychologists. 
                They provide a number of mental services to people of all ages and for a variety of 
                mental health issues. These issues can range from moderate to chronic and difficult.</p>
            <p>They may also work in areas such as research, instruction, and supervision, capacity 
                building and assessment, policymaking, and other things that promote mental health. 
                In addition, they are able to provide medical and compensation advice. They are 
                skilful in the assessment and diagnosis of mental diseases and difficulties. To 
                be a clinical psychologist entails conducting research, educating, and evaluating 
                patients. Avoidance, detection, analysis, and therapy are all common topics for 
                investigation. They assist in the making and execution of treatments in a variety 
                of contexts, as well as the evaluation of prognosis.</p>
            <p>These experts work in a variety of venues, involving clinics, outpatient clinics, 
                government departments, as well as private practice. The most popular specialty 
                is clinical psychology. They have typically served a more severely helpless 
                community than counselling psychologists, but the distinction is becoming increasingly
                blurred.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Forensic Psychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>Forensic psychologists, a part of the many types of psychologists, are scientists 
                who also practice in this field. They use clinical expertise, concept, and 
                abilities to better understand and operate justice processes, as well as undertake 
                research in related fields. Also, they frequently work in judicial, administrative, 
                and family law settings, assisting litigants, criminals, survivors, and official 
                and community-based staff.</p>
            <p>They specialize where it involves psychology and the law. This can also include 
                serving as an advisor in criminal or civil matters, leading paternity exams, and 
                counselling those who have become victims of crime. They undertake responsibilities 
                like examining young and adult convicts, dealing with child witnesses, determining 
                the ability to appear in court, and providing professional testimony when needed, 
                which is commonly seen as a detective attempting to capture felons. They have a 
                wide range of tasks, but many of them are related to the criminal justice process. 
                In the legal system, they play a critical role in deciding a criminal’s mental state.</p>
            <p>As opposed to other types, these people get involved in the forensic side. 
                Undertaking convict screens and examinations, providing trial mental exams, 
                and conferring with attorneys, advocates, prison staff, or judicial staff on 
                the mental well-being of convicts are some of the main responsibilities of this 
                position. Inmates may get mental health treatment from them in the form of group 
                treatments, such as drug addiction treatment or anger control, and individual 
                counselling. Most people believe that forensic investigators exclusively help 
                criminals, although they regularly assist victims of numerous crimes. In a 
                sexual assault case, for example, they may assist a kid in testifying in court 
                or assisting an assault victim in their recovery upon being assaulted.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Personality Psychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>A personality psychologist examines how someone’s personality influences the 
                ways they engage with the environment. They study how personality types influence 
                how they act in social settings, how they react to others, how they deal with 
                issues, and how they manage to live with tension. They look at the many sides 
                of personalities and how specific facts affect one’s life as well as what they 
                do. Experts in the subject of this are concerned with a broad variety of issues 
                with practical implications.</p>
            <p>They mostly work with persons who have personality disorders and are having 
                trouble functioning. They try to manage or deal with their difficulties. 
                Personality disorders are thought to be produced by biological or genetic effects 
                by some while others believe they are created by early life events that hinder 
                full function. They might look at how personality develops and if altering is 
                possible. They could also look at whether other personal characteristics are 
                linked to certain illnesses or disorders, how personality impacts people’s decisions, 
                numerous elements that impact personality development.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Military Psychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>They deal with those victims who are currently serving in the military. A 
                psychologist might be a military person or operate as a freelancer. Them, like 
                clinical psychologists, require a medical degree and regulated technical expertise. 
                This job might involve things like counseling troops who are going through a hard 
                time or mental anguish, doing research into various areas of military life, and 
                assisting personnel in their adjustment back to a normal life. They are an essential 
                type of psychologists to society.</p>
            <p>There are several fields of study that are only available to this. Officer applicants 
                are evaluated by psychologists in this profession to assess whether or not individuals

                important individuals when it comes to helping a business step up its game. 
                That is by lowering cost and maximizing output by determining what is necessary 
                and what is not. They need to have a master’s degree to be able to perform at 
                their best. They take different forms when they perform. Sometimes on resources 
                and sometimes test specialists. The seriousness and intensity increase with the

                tests such as IQ tests, personality tests, performance, etc.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Consumer Psychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>This is one of the most important types of psychology when it comes to the 
                marketing world. Behind being able to fully comprise a market and its sales, 
                companies may have an invisible hand at their side, making all the magic happen. 
                Most of the time, that is a consumer psychologist. They do their job by analyzing 
                the consumers and determining what they are looking for, which makes things easy 
                for the business that hired them to produce exactly what is necessary. Their job 
                profile also includes identifying the target audience, analyzing consumer behaviour, 
                and strategically tackling them with innovative ideas. They focus on consumer 
                behaviour and take a deeper look at what the consumers are in look for.</p>
            <p>This job role mainly aims to get into the consumer’s mind, and through that to 
                elevate the sales level of the company. That makes the consumer psychologists 
                really important because it is upon them that the sales of a company may rest. 
                They develop strategies to promote markets and businesses. Wrong predictions 
                and ill-timed suggestions can take the company apart.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Child Psychologist – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>Among the types of psychologists, Child psychologists are those who help 
                children with mental health issues. This includes helping children go 
                through stressful events such as parents’ divorce, a previous trauma, 
                bullying as well as guiding them away from behavioural problems. These 
                professionals deal with children who are also diagnosed with syndromes 
                such as autism, learning disabilities, OCD, phobias, and fears, among 
                many other child-related issues. Their focus is mainly on these important 
                and basic issues that can have a huge effect on a child’s life.</p>
            <p>Things get extra complicated when it comes to children because incidents 
                are common where traumatized or small kids refuse to speak up. The tricky 
                and important part is to give an accurate diagnosis and an accurate plan 
                on how to better the child’s situation. This process may or may not involve 
                the child’s family or loved ones. Most of the time, the families are involved 
                and the psychologist is likely to advise them on how best they can be of help. 
                The process may also involve group therapy where the family as a collective 
                participate to eliminate the issue. Especially if the child is bothered by 
                a factor such as neglect. This goes hand in hand with developmental and 
                clinical psychology since they must have a clear understanding of human 
                development to tackle the issues.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>School Psychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>They work closely with institutes and are dedicated to helping children 
                with the stress they go through in a school setting. This can be academic 
                pressure, sports pressure, behavioural issues, emotional problems, or 
                societal issues. These individuals are important when it comes to the 
                system of producing able citizens since an academic centre plays a vital 
                role when it comes to a child’s growth. This is the first place that they 
                deal with society outside of their family. The process of school counselling 
                involves parents when necessary. Especially if the child’s difficulties at 
                schools are in relation to what is happening at home. The process is broad 
                since it not only cares about academic performance but all sorts of other 
                issues school children can be associated with. One of them being drug abuse.</p>
            <p>Overall, these specialists are focusing on improving the educational experience 
                and the output. Bettering the process can include therapy sessions, programs, 
                and other activities the way the school psychologist sees fit. These professionals 
                pay considerable attention not just the behavioural but physical development, 
                and thus health promotions are always upheld.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Personality Psychologists – Types of Psychologists</strong></h3>
            <p>Personality psychologists perform the basics of psychology. That is analysing a 
                persons personality and behaviour and determining how it affects their life, 
                directly or indirectly. This includes how they behave in a social situation, 
                their sense of humour, how they deal with situations, how they deal with people, 
                the way they react to stressful situations among other factors. The basic belief 
                is, who a person is affects everything and everyone around them. In other words, 
                the negative and positive situations one may in be plainly due to who he or she is.</p>
            <p>Personality psychologists can determine personality disorders in their clients 
                through observations and testing. While it is debatable as to what causes 
                personality disorders, these professionals are responsible for diagnosing 
                them and coming up with a treatment plan in favor of the client/patient. 
                Personality psychologists deal with different people from different upbringings. 
                Thus, they need to be sensitive to those factors when it comes to determining 
                diagnosis and treatment plans. They are, as always are responsible to make the 
                client understand what is happening to them. Understanding the client enough to 
                know their preferences when it comes to certain decisions is also important. 
                They use different theories and methods to arrive at a final decision.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Engineering Psychologists</strong></h3>

                creating more user-friendly devices which up the usage and sales. Their

                They also benefit the healthcare industry by taking part in creating devices 
                to aid the health industry. As opposed to other engineers, engineering 
                psychologists are armed with the knowledge of human factors and errors 
                that can be a concern when it comes to the digital world.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Environmental Psychologists</strong></h3>

                associate with on a daily basis, work environment, as well as concerns regarding 
                natural environments. In other words, they can tell someone the effect of their 
                environment on the recent anger issues they are experiencing, while working on 
                issues such as climate change, or protecting endangered species.</p>

                improve the environment. They can effectively work their way through identifying 
                how environmental issues can alter good health in different situations, even if 
                they are drastically different.</p><br>
