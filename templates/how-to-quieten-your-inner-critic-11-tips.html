            <p>The inner critic is an inner voice that judges condemn, or degrades a person whether or not
                self-criticism is objectively justified. A highly active inner critic can take charge of one’s emotional
                well being and dignity. Educating yourself on how to quieten your inner critic might help you with
                strengthening the sustainer inside yourself.</p>
            <p>We all have two different voices inside ourselves: one that is bringing up, and one that is censorious;
                one that lifts up, and one that drags us down. Both of these voices have a role to play in ourselves.
                Our inner sustainer brings self-compassion and inspiration, while the inner critic criticizes where
                you’ve gone wrong and what you need to do to set things right. But for most people, the inner critic
                goes way zealous, throwing dart after dart of scolding, shaming, pedantic and criticism. It’s big and
                powerful, while the inner sustainer is small and unsuccessful, wearing down your mood, self-worth and
                flexibility. Happily, there are good ways to reboot this balance. Read on our guide on how to quieten
                your inner critic.</p>

            <h2 id="topic-1">What is Self Critical Thinking? What are Self Critical Thoughts?</h2>
            <p>Self-criticism is generally experienced as negative internal thoughts about one’s self or, more exactly,
                about one’s behaviours or qualities. When self-critical thoughts apply widely rather than focus on a
                specific behaviour, they may be more likely to affect well-being negatively. Educating yourself on
                self-critical thinking might help you on your journey on how to quieten your inner critic.</p>
            <p>A person who is self-critical tends to estimates themselves and their actions very strictly, focusing
                on their weaknesses, shortcomings, and faults. More of a personality attribute, so some people are
                more arrogant than others. But if you think about it, to some extent we’re all our own worse critics.
                We’re so used to being inside our own heads, that we may not even realize how self-critical we are.
                Always try paying attention to the kinds of thoughts you have. Then you may find you are harder on
                yourself than you think.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Why are we self-critical?</strong>Adaptive purpose of observing our own behaviour and
                    protecting us from psychological and physical threats.</p>

            <h2 id="topic-2">Consequences of Self Criticism and Self Critical Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Self-criticism is sometimes positive, allowing us to encourage personal growth:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We are able to acknowledge our faults and failures and learn from them</li>
                <li>Capability to prepare more humility</li>
                <li>We can overcome or change unwanted routines or weaknesses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, most of the time self-criticism is damaging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It can prevent us from taking positive risks, being expressed about our opinions, and believing
                    in ourselves</li>
                <li>We blame ourselves for every negative situation even when it might be out of our limits</li>
                <li>Always compare ourselves to others, which normally makes us feel worse about ourselves</li>
                <li>We are never satisfied with our achievements and have incredibly high standards</li>
                <li>Have a negative influence on mental wellbeing: Anxiety, eating disorders, social anxiety and etc</li>
                <li>Activates negative feelings: Sadness, anger, guilt, disappointment, shame, worthlessness, hopelessness</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="topic-3">How to Quieten Your Inner Critic – Self Critical Thoughts to Inner Peace</h2>
            <p>Many of us may see self-compassion as related to mindfulness or gratitude. A worthy goal that is hard to
                turn into constant practice. But, it is possible to change our inner address, with benefits for not
                only our single happiness but perhaps that of society.</p>
            <p>If you tend to be unduly critical of yourself, you’re not alone. Most people experience self-doubt and
                harsh self-reflection. Fortunately, however, you don’t have to be a sufferer of your own verbal abuse.
                Instead, take steps to enterprising address your negative thoughts and develop a more productive
                dialogue with yourself. Here are 11 proven ways on how to quieten your inner critic:</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Observe how self-critical thoughts operates inside you</strong></h3>
            <p>Notice any discharge or minimization of your pain, your needs and your rights. Watch how little thoughts
                foreground your accomplishments:</p>
            <p><em><strong><mark style="background-color: yellow">“Oh, anyone could have done that . . . but it wasn’t perfect . . . what about the
                other times when you messed up?”</mark></strong></em></p>
            <p>Observe any tedious uncertainty or discouragement of your hopes and dreams.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve recognized you don’t have evidence to support your self-critical thought, try returning it
                with a more realistic one that is focused less on condemnation and more on improvement. For example,
                “I didn’t do as well as I thought, but a B is still a reasonable mark. I still have many chances to
                do well in this class.”</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>When the inner critic starts striking away, know that your inner sustainer is a
                    refuge and an ally</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Foster the Flows of Compassion</strong></h3>
            <p>Compassion has as much to do with our relationships with other people as much as with ourselves.
                Encouraging connection and ways we can care for others adjust our tricky brains to draw meaning from
                these relationships, instead of the self. When we feel supported by others, and safe, we feel better
                able to expand that to others.</p>
            <p>The goal is to create a compassionate mindset where we not only feel compassion for ourselves and
                others but are open to getting it too. Self-compassion is really acknowledging what it is to be human:
                what our basic needs are, which is a sense of accordance, and what moves us away from that.”</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Fight the Tough Self Critical Thoughts</strong></h3>
            <p>Some self-critical thoughts are harder to control than others. For example, “I am ugly.” “I’m not good
                enough for something.” “I am a horrible person.” “I will forever be alone.” “I am a failure in life.”
                For these kinds of thoughts, it may be helpful to think about whether they set out a real purpose for
                you. Do they help you achieve your goals, or do they make you feel really bad about yourself?</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Stop Comparing Yourself to Others</strong></h3>
            <p>In today’s immensely competitive culture, it’s so easy for us to dive into the trap of comparing
                ourselves to others And when our mind plays tricks on us, making us feel like we don’t calculate,
                our harsh self-critic sinks us deeper into the pit of servitude and negative self-image.</p>
            <p>Try to stop looking outward and  always start turning inward instead</p>
            <p>Every time you emit a stare and point a finger toward someone else, there are three fingers pointing
                back at you. That’s your body literally reminding you to reorient your sight back inward. Never forget
                that you are whole, full, you are worthy and you are capable. If only you learned that the only person
                you should compare yourself to is the previous you, then you’d recognize the power that is already
                endowed within you.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Comparison is the instigator:</strong>It’s the match that sparks the fire upon which your
                    inner critic flourishes. Be cautious of it. Don’t try to breathe air into it. Shift your eye inward
                    instead – that’s how you domestic it.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Meditate to Become More Mindful – Combat Self Critical Thoughts</strong></h3>
            <p>Meditation will always help you in making the unconscious conscious. Meditation will help you on how to
                quieten your inner critic. It’ll help you raise your recognition of your inner voice so you can shine a
                light on it and make a change. That will help you become more mindful. And mindfulness is simply the
                ability to recognize thoughts before engaging with them.</p>
            <p>When you recognize that you are not just your thoughts, you are just the observer of your thoughts—you
                automatically begin to change the way you think. You sensibly begin to choose which thoughts you want
                to give your attention to.</p>
            <p>Practising mindfulness allows you to accept self-critical thoughts as they appear without criticizing,
                and then let go of those negative thoughts. In practising mindfulness, you will obviously learn to
                focus on the positive sides of yourself. Mindfulness also helps us to recognize that we are all humans
                who are sometimes self-critical, which makes us feel less alone.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Stop Ruminating</strong></h3>
            <p>When you make a mistake or you’ve had a bad day, you may be convinced to re-play the events over and
                over inside your head. But, often reminding yourself of that shaming thing you did, or that doubtful
                thing you said, will only make you feel worse and it won’t solve any problem. It won’t help you on
                how to quieten your inner critic</p>
            <p>When you find yourself considering and not actively solving the problem – don’t waste your time
                telling yourself, “Don’t think about it.” The more you try to neglect or avoid thinking about
                something, the more you’re likely to focus on it. Instead, try to distract yourself with an
                activity – like going for a walk, organizing your office desk, or talking about a completely
                different subject with someone – and stop the critical thoughts before they coil out of control.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Quieten your Tone to Quieten your Inner Critic</strong></h3>
            <p>It is not just what your inner oration says – how it says it matters, too. Speaking to yourself with
                kindness and love can “feel like a verbal hug” by activating the physiological memory of feeling safe.
                Controlling an open, upright position and friendly facial expression can similarly inspire your mind,
                even if it doesn’t reflect how you feel.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Embrace the Practice on How to Quieten your Inner Critic</strong></h3>
            <p>Learning to be compassionate takes daily authority, just like physical fitness. “If you want to feel the
                benefits … you must put the work in.” But, the most difficult part is allowing yourself permission to
                do it and accepting that you deserve to be at peace with yourself. Practice yourself gradually to
                quieten your inner critic.</p>
            <p>Making that commitment traces the start of a “lifelong journey”. The longest relationship someone will
                ever have is with themselves – “so would you like to take your self-critic with you or your caring friend?”</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Examine the Evidence on How to Quieten your Inner Critic</strong></h3>
            <p>Learn to recognize when your critical thoughts are really negative. If you think, “I’m never going
                to be able to quit this job and run my own business,” examine the evidence that supports and refutes
                this negative thought. It’s helpful to write it down always. Take a paper and draw a line down the
                middle of the paper. On one side, list all the proofs that support your thoughts. On another side,
                write down all the proofs to the opposing. Looking at evidence on both sides of the argument can help
                you look at the situation more sensibly and less emotionally.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Argue Against your Self Critical Thoughts</strong></h3>
            <p>Write down one of some normal lines like “You always fail.” And then write down three or more believable
                refutations. Imagine members of your family or your friends standing up for you, and talking back to
                the critic. Combine with them, not with it. Always talk to yourself in useful ways. Such as:</p>
            <p>“This criticism has a grain of truth in it, but everything else is exaggerated or not true” or “This
                is not helping me or my thoughts and I don’t have to listen to it.”</p>
            <p>You might also try concerning the inner critic as something that lacks reliability. Imagine it as an
                amusing character, like a silly cartoon character. Place it “over there” in your mind, outside the
                fundamental of your being — like that annoying person in a meeting who is always critical but whom
                everybody overlooks after a while. Remind yourself daily that you are on your way to know how to
                quieten your inner critic.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>Start a Daily Self-gratitude Journaling Habit</strong></h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Wear gratitude like a cloak and it will feed every corner of your
                    life –<strong>Rumi, Persian Poet ( 13th Century )</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This saying still holds true today</p>
            <p>Every day writes down one important thing about yourself that you’re grateful for. You’re simply
                taking the time to acknowledge the success that’s happening in your life thanks to your continued
                effort and hard work. This positive self-talk can be considered as an addition to the practice of
                self-compassion. If you always compliment other people, don’t you deserve to compliment yourself?</p>

            <h2 id="topic-4">What Matters to You? Struggling with your Inner Critic</h2>
            <p>Being hard on yourself and beating yourself up isn’t really helpful. In fact, it might be one of the
                possible reasons why you’re stuck where you are today. You can silence your inner critic and weak its
                power over you by becoming more mindful, imagining a silly character dubbing it, comparing yourself
                to no one but you, and starting a self-gratitude journal. When you learn how to limit self-criticism,
                you automatically balance its negative impact on you. This then allows you to break free from your
                boundaries, achieve your highest potential, and find more satisfaction in your life.</p>
