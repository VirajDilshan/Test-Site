                If you work with people, you will almost certainly need to resolve a disagreement at some point. You
                could be called upon to peace make a disagreement between two colleagues in your department. In addition,
                you could be enraged by something a coworker allegedly said about you in a meeting. You could also need to
                work out a disagreement with a customer over a missed deadline. Also, not to forget household. A household
                might feel like a battleground at times, with continual tension and conflict. You can generally tell what
                type of day it’s going to be from the minute one wakes up. Similarly, bad days might have you walk around on
                eggshells. Conflict resolution is essential during these times.
            </p>
            <p>
                We frequently consider conflict to be a bad thing. It conjures up images of squabbling and rage. In other
                words, conflict is an unavoidable aspect of life. It happens when people have opposing viewpoints and views
                on how things should be done. Existence is difficult to live without conflict: in families, friendships,
                the job, politics…basically in every aspect of life. What matters is how we deal with and settle our disputes.
                However, unsurprisingly, our children’s first point of contact with conflict is at home. Your kid will utilize
                the conflict-resolution skills you teach them at school, with their classmates, and throughout their life. We
                never stop learning and improving talents, but the basis is laid in childhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like a wise man once said,
                <blockquote>
                The quality of our lives depends not on whether or not we have conflicts, but on how we respond to them.
            <br> <br>- Thomas Crum
                </blockquote>

            <p>
                Conflict is a good and necessary element of every relationship, particularly at work. It indicates that
                individuals are actively negotiating their wants and expectations with others, which is exactly what keeps
                us satisfied in our connections. A dispute occurs when two people hold opposing viewpoints. In layman’s terms,
                conflict is just a quarrel between two people or between members of a group. In other words, there is no way two
                people can think the same way, and their mental processes and comprehension are certain to differ. Similarly,
                individual disagreements result in disputes and clashes. Conflict develops when people have opposing beliefs,
                perspectives, needs, or interests and are unable to reach an agreement.Conflict is a good and necessary element

<!--            topic 2-->
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">What is conflict resolution?</h2>
            <p>
                Conflict resolution is the informal or formal procedure used by two or more parties to reach a peaceful conclusion to a disagreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, there are a number of typical cognitive and emotional traps that can push conflict and lead to the
                need for conflict resolution. However, most of these are unconscious. Conflict resolution abilities are necessary
                for a variety of jobs in a variety of industries. In other words, this necessity stems from the reality that
                disagreement reduces productivity and creates a challenging work environment, resulting in unwelcome worker
                turnover and low morale. Individuals who are good at resolving conflicts are usually good mediators, logical,
                and they know how to deal with problematic people from a place of empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Family issues are a natural aspect of life. Above all, we’re all unique individuals with various perspectives,
                personalities, and approaches to life. However, we shouldn’t expect to always agree. Continuous disagreement
                and tension may be stressful and damaging to our relationships. Effectively resolving family disagreements
                also teaches children how to negotiate and find compromises, preparing them for a lifetime of good connections.
            </p>

<!--            topic 3-->
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">A few ways for conflict resolution.</h2>
            <p>
                It is important we master the art of dealing with conflicts. Above all, it is a quality that can come in handy, anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are a few tips on how to reach that point.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>1. Being a good listener for conflict resolution</strong></h4>
            <p>
                You need to understand that your definition of right or wrong is only your opinion. Each individual is
                entitled to their opinion, and you must understand that in order to solve issues that arise due to opinion
                differences. The goal of active listening is to pay attention to what the other person is saying. In other
                words, this is a universal talent that any type of professional should understand. It is frequently utilized
                by salesmen to better connect with consumers during a pitch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most essential thing you should do to learn to listen is to have an open mind. For instance, take attention
                to how the other person expresses themselves. Then, using the same language, answer. This shows that you were
                paying attention and helps to clear up any misunderstandings regarding the topics being addressed. Also, if
                you’re unsure about something, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Concentrate on determining the other person’s
                objectives if you are trying to engage in conflict resolution.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>2. Being patient for conflict resolution</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Conflicts are not very easy to solve. Conflict resolution is tough because individuals dislike being wrong
                and will often stick to their positions on issues as a result. You’ll need patience if you want to resolve
                a disagreement with someone like them. If you are a person like this, practice patience. It’s crucial to
                remember that although the answer is clear, the difficulty would not be fixed away soon. Generally, you
                should stop and listen to each person and give equal weight to each viewpoint. Even though the meaning is
                clear, jumping to a conclusion might make one feel excluded from the judgment call process.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>3. Optimistic behaviour for conflict resolution</strong></h4>
            <p>
                It’s difficult to get an agreement on a strategy when no one is satisfied with it. Even if you do agree, a
                half-hearted agreement isn’t enough to encourage you to keep your part of the deal. This can even be used as
                an excuse for a partner to better cope with the disagreement entirely. Keeping the dialogue going further by
                just being optimistic about your conflict resolution activities is a wonderful method to do so. Obstacles
                abound in disagreements, and if you want to reach a settlement, you must be prepared to beat them. Above all,
                heading into the disagreement with a good attitude might assist other members who are afraid about the encounter
                feel more comfortable.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>4. Understand your emotions for conflict resolution</strong></h4>
            <p>
                When our feelings get involved in settling a disagreement, we cease being reasonable about it. Take a Family
                Space Out if you’re angry, upset, or scared. It does not imply your child or partner “ends up winning” if you
                want to take a few seconds to recover your breath or restore your cool. It simply implies that you’ve decided
                to counter an emotionally intense scenario. Do what it takes you to maintain your sanity through the process.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>5. Don’t stray away from the subject</strong></h4>
            <p>
                When you’re in a fight, it’s easy to get off track and question, “How did we start talking about gas and wind
                up yelling over how I never pay for anything?”  When you notice your child – or yourself – wandering off on a
                stray. An important key to conflict resolution is focusing on the problem at hand. Take step by step.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>6. Communicate openly for conflict resolution</strong></h4>
            <p>
                When a problem is settled, ties between those engaged in the issue may not necessarily start to improve.
                This connection must be fostered once a cure has been discovered in order to reduce potential problems.
                The greatest way to establish a strong, close friendship after a dispute is for both sides to communicate
                openly. This permits both sides to follow up on one other and ensure that the plan’s terms are being followed.
                If new obstacles develop, honest dialogue should make it simpler for members for conflict resolution without
                jeopardizing any prior progress.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>7. Being emotionally intelligent for conflict resolution</strong></h4>
            <p>
                <blockquote>Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.
                <br> <br> - Winston Churchill</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                The capacity to sense and comprehend other strong thoughts, but also your own, is referred to as emotional
                intelligence. When dealing with disagreement, this ability is crucial since it stops the issue from growing. It will
                be simpler to speak with your opponents sans upsetting them if you can successfully understand their feelings.
                Acknowledging and reducing the current conflict uncertainty, rage, and disappointment allows all engaged to think
                outside the box and sensibly about a remedy.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>8. You are not trying to win. You are trying to resolve.</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Wars are won. The problems are resolved. When you resolve a disagreement, you aren’t always “right” or “wrong.”
                Based on the situation, it might indicate agreeing to disagree. Also, teach your kids that just because a
                disagreement is resolved does not in itself imply he or she will achieve everything they want. This could
                imply accepting that rules are clear and that’s simply the way things are. The middle ground is a good example
                of compromising for conflict resolution.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>9. Use the conflicts to teach your kids</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Parenting with purpose is a term we like to use. Whenever your child gets into a fight, use it as a chance to
                teach him new skills. Recognize your goal: to provide your child with conflict-resolution skills that he may
                apply not only at home but also with others. Whenever you stand and debate or “battle,” he is learning that
                disagreement is bad and emotionally charged and that it frequently ends in a scuffle. The kid is figuring out
                that the goal is to “win.” However, if someone wants to retain a marriage, a career, or a relationship, they
                will have to tackle things differently and strive to settle problems rather than win every battle.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>10. Understand that growth doesn’t stop</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Your personal conduct is the most powerful weapon you have in influencing your kids. In other words, it’s
                the one aspect of your life over which you have total control. You can’t force your youngster to stick up
                and dispute with her. It may look that way but consider twice when entrusting such authority to someone else.
                If you’ve been battling with your child for years, you may feel powerless. It is not too late to make adjustments
                in your household, even if there has been a pattern of harmful conflict in history. Even yesterday – just a day
                ago – is now a distant memory. “Life always gives you a second chance,” as the adage goes. Future is the name of
                the game.” This is important for conflict resolution.

            <h4><strong>Assertiveness</strong></h4>
            <p>
                A boss may decide to call a discussion amongst two workers who have been involved in a visible quarrel.
                An individual could approach a coworker with someone with whom they’re having an issue and propose that
                they strive to find methods to dwell better. Including,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Precise</li>

                <li>Command</li>
                <li>Controls Emotions</li>

                <li>Tension management</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4><strong>Empathetic</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Those in dispute can be asked to define how the other is thinking or feeling, as well as how the scenario
                seems to the other side, by a peacemaker for conflict resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sensitivity is really a valuable quality for negotiators, who has to be able to comprehend each party’s
                point of view while not always agreeing with them. Empathetic ways include,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Requesting Feedback</li>
                <li>Integration</li>

                <li>Identifying Differences</li>
                <li>Considering Different Opinions</li>

                <li>Ideas are welcome.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4><strong>Facilitation</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Supervisors from competing areas can organize a collaborative group discussion with their staff to look for
                solutions to existing issues. Useful communication strategies could also be used to ensure peace from occurring
                in the first place during collective decision making.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coming up with ideas</li>
                <li>Partnership</li>
                <li>Conflict Resolution</li>
                <li>Diplomatic</li>
                <li>Humane</li>
                <li>Modest</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4><strong>Accountability</strong></h4>
            <p>
                As the effectiveness of the performance assessment, a director could record a persistent complainer’s
                conflict-initiating actions. Because the employee can no longer deny the situation arises, the boss aids
                in the establishment of obligation for conflict resolution.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flexible</li>
                <li>Partnership</li>

                To easily avoid areas of contention, a superior when it comes to conflict resolution could alter the responsibilities
                of two conflict-prone employees. Conductive material win-win solutions is another example of innovation.

            <p><blockquote>Every conflict we face in life is rich with positive and negative potential. It can be a source
            of inspiration, enlightenment, learning, transformation, and growth-or rage, fear, shame, entrapment, and
            resistance. The choice is not up to our opponents, but to us, and our willingness to face and work through
            them. <br> <br> - Kenneth Cloke</blockquote></p>
            <p>
                Home is everyone’s safe haven. It is where one looks forward to coming after a long day. If the home is
                messy and full of fights, that is not a situation anyone wants to walk into. Below are a few ways on how
                you can make sure that home remains peaceful and heavenly.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>Work together to solve the problem</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Encourage your children to work with each other to resolve conflicts. It’s critical should you assist children
                in approaching problems in a positive light and believing that they can fix this all together. In addition, this
                aids them to grow up as people who try to see others’ views and take fair decisions. This can come in handy even
                at the preschool where they will be working with outsiders for the first time. In other words, training them to
                process and validate conflicting opinions and needs takes them a long way.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>Keeping the cool</strong></h4>
            <p>
                In a conflict scenario, it may be extremely difficult for children (or grownups) to maintain their composure,
                specifically if they believe they are being condemned or criticized. Strong reactions or withdrawal from the
                point are frequent reactions. When coming to the topic, it may be beneficial to take a little break to allow
                everybody to cool down. If emotions are overwhelming and you feel more affected then you should call a time out
                before you lose it. Trying to solve one issue should not make way to another.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>Practice empathy among each other</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Teach children how and where to pay attention to and care about other people’s questions and issues. Encourage
                them to imagine what it would be like to be in the other people’s place and to inquire why the other person
                desires things. Encouraging kids to imagine how another person feels is good practice for empathy. Above all,
                they understand that others have feelings too. From their perspective, they would not like it if it happened to
                them. In other words, children tend to care about what they want more. Helping them identify what hurts them and
                making them understand that it hurts the next person too, makes way to empathy from small days.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>When to stop</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Some conflicts are too large for children to resolve, and the dispute began to increase. It’s critical for you
                to intervene if the disputes grow too heated or escalate into physical violence. If a collaborative answer is
                not feasible, you may still assist your kid in considering the options given to him or her and selecting the
                best one. It is important to understand that it is a learning process. They do not have the full potential to
                not get into a fight. Knowing when to come in between and settle the score, is important.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">How to manage conflict at home: tips!</h2>
            <p>
                Below are a few tips for managing conflict at home.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>Don’t forget your loved ones</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Most of us have hectic schedules and several obligations. We fight each day to make a living and keep up with
                the fast world. However, set out a few moments each day to speak with your family, enjoy a tale with, or cook
                supper together. When children see you prioritizing connections, they understand that they are valuable to you
                and that you adore them. Do not let yourself forget that family comes first. You can find another job, but you
                don’t want your family to fall apart.
            </p> <br>
            <h4><strong>Talk to each other</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Successful relationships require excellent interaction, which allows household participants to feel heard and
                accepted. Daily, give enough time to chat and share knowledge. When children observe people speaking to one
                another with compassion and care, they learn how to interact properly as well. This also allows family members
                to know that they always have someone to talk to. Building such an open environment leaves no space for secrets
                and lies. This way, you can be there for your family even when you are busy.
            </p>
            <h4><strong>Do things together</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Functioning together as a family gives them the feeling that they have something worthy of contributing. It’s
                also a great way for youngsters to practice problem-solving and life choice abilities. Help each other out if
                you can. Allow family members to know that you are there to assist, support, love, and care for them. Above all,
                recognizing a family member’s wants and giving assistance can assist to reduce tension and anxiety. It helps kids
                understand that home is a tight-knit place where each other is there for others. In addition, growing up in a place
                like that, children are less likely to keep issues to themselves or commit wrongdoings. The togetherness makes them
                understand that whatever they do impacts the whole family.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, conflict is necessary. We are all opinions. Thus, to decide the best options, it is necessary
                we have an insight to different opinions. However, if conflict resolution methods don’t work, you can bring your
                problems to a <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/clinicians/">professional therapist</a>. This treatment method
                approaches the parties facing the issue and help them get to the core. Thus, there is always an end to any conflict.
