            <p>In this article we are going to touch on personality and what the criteria 
                are for a personality disorder. Then we will explore further how to gain 
                personality before going into depth about dependent personality disorder.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">Let’s discuss personality</h2>
            <p>No two human beings are alike. Everyone is different. Various 
                characteristics and traits set each person apart. Apart from gender, 
                morality, values, there is also personality. Each individual has a 
                personality of different traits, that sets them apart from others. 
                Some individuals have a combination or mixture of this. Personality 
                is what sets someone apart from another. It is what adds colour to 
                the world. Search as you might, you’d probably never find two people 
                who think, act and talk alike. Everyone will have their good and bad 
                that will set them apart. Even identical twins can have different 
                personalities.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">Does personality change?</h2>
            <p>As a person goes through life, they get specific characteristics and traits 
                that set them apart. The majority of traits change through the life course. 
                But some personality traits remain constant throughout. Some people 
                genetically get specific features and characteristics more than others.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">How is personality acquired?</h2>
            <p>Personality is something we partly inherit and partly get as we go through 
                life. Both genes and experiences play a role in shaping a person’s 
                personality. We may inherit an anxious nature from one of our parents. 
                We can also get traits or ways of being based on our experiences when 
                we are younger. A child brought up in a dangerous, unsafe environment 
                may also go on to develop an anxious personality. There are so many 
                different personality types that one can identify. One person might 
                be highly outgoing, confident,  whereas another person 
                will be timid and shy.</p><br>            

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">What is a personality disorder?</h2>
            <p>When personality, our way of being has an impairing effect on a person’s 
                life, their loved ones, coworkers, colleagues and friends, one can say 
                that it becomes a disorder. It is especially so if these traits 
                seriously change the everyday routine and natural functioning of a person. 
                Since personality evolves and short term stressors impact how we 
                all behave. Psychologists and psychiatrist often want a long-standing 
                pattern of unhelpful ways of being before diagnosing a 
                personality disorder.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">What is a dependent personality disorder?</h2>
            <p>There are certain traits that go with a dependent personality disorder. 
                The good news is that individuals can change the traits mentioned below, 
                and they aren’t set in stone. With the help of professional psychologists 
                and loved ones, an individual can overcome these traits.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">Hard time making decisions</h2>
            <p>Doubtfulness is crucial when it comes to dependent personality disorder. 
                These individuals rely too heavily on others’ ideas, thoughts, 
                and opinions and are afraid to expand their freedom.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">Not trusting their judgement</h2>
            <p>They rely more on others to make decisions for them. In other words, 
                they aren’t confident in themselves and don’t believe in their capabilities 
                strengths. Instead, they depend on what others think, say and believe. 
                Unwilling to form their ideas. Instead, they take what others say very 
                seriously that they might be stressed by the absence of a loved one or 
                partner in their life. These individuals have trouble believing in 
                their capacity to form accurate judgements and decisions and pass 
                on the responsibility of taking a crucial or significant decision 
                to a loved one or a partner instead of taking on the task or 
                responsibility themselves. People with a dependent personality 
                disorder might worry about abandonment, losing a loved one or 
                someone close to them. If a relationship were to end they would 
                want to form another connection shortly after. There is a strong 
                desire for approval and support.</p><br>
                
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-8">Over eagerness to please</h2>
            <p>Everyone at some point in their life will depend on others. When this 
                dependency becomes paralysing and detrimental to a person and all 
                around them, it turns into a disorder. Individuals with dependent 
                personality disorder aren’t assertive. They tend to agree with other 
                people quickly, sometimes against their free will. They are driven by 
                fear and anxiety and an over-eagerness to please and appear friendly. 
                Someone with a dependent personality might live with an abusive partner 
                instead of leaving them just because they are afraid.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-9">Not confident in their decision making</h2>
            <p>Another trait is requiring excessive reassurance and advice from others. 
                A person with dependent personality disorder tends to rely too heavily on 
                others to make a significant decision. Indecisiveness is a major 
                characteristic of a person’s with a dependent personality disorder. 
                Difficulty thinking for themselves and making independent choices. 
                Underestimate and undervalue their strengths and skills. They struggle 
                to see value in their accomplishments.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-10">‘Saying no’ to compliments</h2>
            <p>Individuals with dependent personality traits are quick to dismiss praise 
                and think that they don’t deserve to be praised. They are afraid of 
                standing out and being different. They struggle to fit in and try their 
                best to conform and fit in with the crowd their whole life. These 
                individuals are afraid of drawing attention to them and believe that 
                the world is a dangerous place and the best way to survive is to lie low 
                and fit and conform with the norms and beliefs of the majority. They are 
                afraid to act independently and assert and express their unique ideas 
                and perspectives because they are worried that this might draw 
                unnecessary attention to them. Try their best not to stick out from 
                the majority. They are over complacent and are ever ready to agree to 
                anything despite even experiencing detrimental personal consequences.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-11">Struggle to make choices</h2>
            <p>When it comes to making choices, both significant and insignificant, these 
                individuals lack the necessary confidence to choose from the options 
                available for them. Instead of deciding on something and believing in 
                themselves to make the right moist suitable choice for themselves and 
                over-reliant and dependent on the opinions and ideas of others. They 
                seek advice excessively and don’t believe their views, opinions, and 
                perspectives are of value or importance. Instead, giving priority to 
                the ideas, opinions and thoughts of others over there and have immense 
                trouble making decisions. These people struggle to decide the best 
                option and take more time and exert more effort than an average person 
                when making decisions.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-12">Avoids responsibility</h2>
            <p>These individuals shun opportunities to take responsibility. They are 
                afraid and anxious to take on the duty. When offered responsibility, 
                they tend to pass the ball to another person instead of shouldering the 
                responsibility and acting with assertiveness and autonomy. These people 
                afraid of shouldering responsibility because they doubt their abilities 
                and capabilities more than ordinary people. Difficulty shoulder 
                responsibility because they don’t trust in themselves and are overly 
                dependent on others to make choices and decisions about their life, even 
                profoundly personal and meaningful choice.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-13">Trouble disagreeing</h2>
            <p>Individuals with dependent personality disorder have trouble disagreeing 
                with others because they are too focused and concerned about what others 
                might think of them. They don’t believe in themselves and have difficulty 
                disagreeing with the opinions and ideas of others. These people are afraid 
                of being unpopular and tend to agree with everything. When it is 
                detrimental to their wellbeing and quality of life. They are scared to 
                voice their own opinions and ideas because of the extreme need for validation
                and over-eagerness to please and gain acceptance from those around them. 
                These individuals don’t value themselves or consider themselves capable 
                of making a valuable contribution to society or the lives of others.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-14">Absence of self-confidence</h2>
            <p>They lack self-confidence and tend to put themselves down. Other key features 
                include devaluing themselves and have trouble appreciating and valuing 
                themselves. They have difficulty being proud and celebrating their 
                accomplishments. Their low levels of confidence lead to low self-esteem, 
                which impacts their performance and productivity. This, in turn, hurts 
                their quality of life and wellbeing and their ability to function 
                effectively and efficiently. Thus this keeps them from achieving their 
                highest potential since they have a disability with a severe lack of 
                self-confidence because they keep undervaluing and looking down on 
                themselves, which becomes a vicious cycle when they experience failure 
                due to the lack of confidence which they attribute to them being not 
                good enough or not being as capable as their peers.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-15">Suffers for others</h2>
            <p>They put others before themselves at all times because of the painful 
                longing for approval and acceptance. There is an internal drive to please 
                others, even at a cost to themselves. Even if others abuse them or treat 
                them with disrespect, they tend to overlook these behaviours and attitudes 
                because they long for the acceptance and approval of others even though it 
                affects their self-confidence and self-esteem. These individuals tolerate 
                behaviours and actions that are unacceptable. They are afraid of being 
                overlooked and undervalued. Driven to please others even at a personal 
                cost that will hurt their wellbeing and quality of life.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-16">Unhappiness being alone</h2>
            <p>People with a dependent personality disorder don’t believe in their ability to 
                function as independent and autonomous individuals. They crave the company of 
                others to an excessive level that severely affects their normal functioning. 
                Often going to extreme lengths to stay in friendships and relationships even 
                when they tend to be toxic and abusive. They go to extreme lengths to be 
                surrounded by others risking their wellbeing and quality of life. These 
                individuals have an insatiable longing for connection and validation by others. 
                They put themselves on the line to be with others due to the extreme and 
                excessive fears of losing others because they dread 
                being alone and by themselves.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-17">Requires close relationships</h2>
            <p>Someone with this actively and obsessively seeks out relationships and 
                connections. They will stick with abusive and crippling partners just 
                because of their deep longing to be with someone and because they are 
                terrified of being by themselves. If one relationship ends, they immediately 
                go after and actively seek another replacement because they feel disabled 
                without another. Because they lack self-assurance and underestimate 
                themselves, they can’t function well without the help of another.</p><br>
           
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-18">Preoccupied with the fear of being alone</h2>
            <p>These individuals dread being by themselves and being alone. They are 
                afraid of their own company and seek out the company of others even 
                though the connections they make are detrimental to their wellbeing and 
                make them feel insecure. They are deeply distressed when they don’t have 
                people around them and in their lives. Struggle to be by themselves and 
                doing things on their own because they undervalue themselves. They rely
                too heavily on partners and friends to get through life challenges and 
                problematic situations. They lack self-worth and self-respect. Many people
                experience aspects of these. It becomes a disorder when it has highly
                negative impacts and impairs normal functioning to a significant or 
                severe degree. These negative aspects can be detrimental when a 
                person goes out into society or engages in an occupation. People 
                who suffer from dependent personality genuinely believe that they 
                are incapable and unable to function independently. Therefore they 
                seek out help and rely too heavily on others as they go about their 
                everyday life. They are afraid of being assertive because they fear 
                that this will alienate the people they have come to rely on.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-19">Dependent Personality Disorder Treatment</h2>
            <h4><strong>Therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>Supportive therapy forms the backbone of dependent personality disorder 
                management. A therapist can enable better understanding, containment and 
                help with problem-solving. Targeted therapies such as CBT can help with 
                assertiveness training and improving self-confidence. Sometimes behaviour 
                exercises, challenging cognitive distortions form part of the therapy.</p>
            <h4><strong>Medication</strong></h4>
            <p>Medication is not considered a first-line treatment option for dependent 
                personality disorder. When medication is used, it’s often for a co-occurring 
                condition such as depression.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-20">Recovery from Dependent Personality Disorder</h2>
            <p>Personality disorders by their very nature cause distress. The goal of 
                treatment is to reduce distress and instil hope. People with dependent 
                personality disorder or traits can learn ways to cope with their distress, 
                challenge their underlying thought patterns and ways of being. It’s 
                possible for these people to lead happy and emotionally fulfilling lives.
