            <p>Dysthymia is a Greek word, meaning the bad state of mind or ill-humour. 
                Although not directly meaning depression, these are two major symptoms 
                of depression. Depression can carry many meanings, ranging from suicidal 
                thoughts to inconsolable hopelessness, delusions, sadness or discouragement, 
                among many others. Depression is not a celebrated visit, and it can make 
                things much worse when it decides to stick around for a very long period of 
                time.</p>
            <p>Dysthymia or Persistent Depressive Disorder is a version of depression. 
                Its symptoms are not as severe as those of major depression and are often 
                referred to as a mild chronic depression. However, it tends to last longer 
                than major depression and is commonly known as mild chronic depression. 
                Those who suffer from persistent depressive disorder are also likely to 
                experience major depressive symptoms from time to time, which is a time 
                frame known as “double depression”. Dysthymia can last up to two years,
                a behaviour rich with depressive symptoms. As such, depression and 
                persistent depressive disorder got a lot in common. Dysthymia includes 
                almost all the symptoms of major depressive disorder except for anhedonia 
                or psychomotor symptoms. </p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">A general understanding of Dysthymia</h2>
            <p>Dysthymia of Persistent Depressive Disorder is as worse as depression gets. 
                Though symptoms are generally believed to be milder than those of major 
                depression, some dysthymias symptoms can take a toll on people more than 
                major depression disorder ever did. At least one-third of patients who 
                are receiving psychotherapy suffer from a persistent depressive disorder. 
                It is more likely to be seen in women, but that does not mean men do not 
                get dysthymia. It is also more likely to arise during the earlier stages 
                of life. Those with this condition are eventually likely to develop at 
                least a few episodes relating to major depressive disorder. However, it 
                may be difficult to identify dysthymia from the mild depression that 
                can last a while after one recovers from a major depressive disorder.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">Noticeable symptoms of Persistent Depressive Disorder</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can vary in intensity, while they 
                often come and go through a period of time. However, the gap between these 
                time frames is not for more than two months. As mentioned before the 
                symptoms are mostly just the same as major depressive disorder, most 
                of the time fewer in number and not as intense.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Having a particularly negative mood or be upset most of the time in the day</li>
                <li>Losing interest in day to day activities, even those that one used to enjoy the most</li>
                <li>Sadness, hopelessness feeling worthless and a general sense of pessimism</li>
                <li>Tiredness and a lack of energy</li>
                <li>Feeling incapable or like they count on nothing</li>
                <li>Easily irritable</li>
                <li>Anger issues intensified</li>
                <li>Choosing to be alone and avoiding social activity or society as a whole</li>
                <li>Thoughts associated with guilt about incidents from the past</li>
                <li>Either eats less or binge eats</li>
                <li>Does not fall asleep, insomniac or oversleeps</li>
                <li>Physically restless</li>
                <li>Fatigue and lethargy</li>
                <li>Inability to focus or make decisions</li>
                <li>Suicidal or likely to self-harm</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">What can cause Dysthymia?</h2>
            <p>This form of depression has no obvious reason, like for many other forms of 
                depression. Chemical abnormalities in the brain, according to mental health 
                specialists, can be one of the leading causes of Dysthymia. Depression is 
                considered to be caused by a variety of reasons. Environmental, psychological, 
                biological, and genetic variables are among them. This disease has also 
                been related to chronic stress and trauma.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Genetics and dysthymia</strong></h3>
            <p>Genetics can also play a role when it comes to disorders related to depression. 
                If a close family member has been diagnosed with persistent depressive 
                disorder, the rest of the family are more at risk of developing the same 
                issue. There is a chance up to 50% that the family members of the same 
                circle developing the disorder, and experiencing its early onset. However, 
                this does not mean that everyone with the genes will develop the issue.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Other illnesses and dysthymia</strong></h3>
            <p>Also, if the individual has a history of anxiety, depression, trauma, they 
                are also more susceptible to developing a chronic depressive situation such 
                as dysthymia. Stressful or traumatic events that can take a toll on a person 
                life can also be a trigger towards dysthymia. Adding to those are chronic 
                physical illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, heart diseases, etc. 
                as well as brain-related issues which can act as potential causes behind 
                the persistent depressive disorder. At least a three-quarter of those 
                diagnosed with dysthymia also are suffering from such a chronic illness.</p><br>            

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">Diagnosing the persistent depressive disorder</h2>
            <p>As with any mental health-related issues, the diagnosis should come from a 
                licenced mental health specialist. The diagnosis is going to be based on 
                symptoms. It is mostly a case of identifying whether the symptoms mean a 
                major depressive disorder or a persistent depressive disorder. if the 
                symptoms are relatively milder than those of major depressive disorder but 
                have lasted a long time, the patient is likely to be diagnosed with persistent 
                depressive disorder. A part of this process is making sure that these symptoms 
                you are experiencing are not caused by an outside factor or a different 
                underlying illness. For example, hypothyroidism can show signs similar to 
                those of dysthymia.</p>

            <p>The doctor may also consider if the patient has been exposed to other factors 
                and illnesses which can cause dysthymia, such as heart diseases. It is 
                important that you provide your doctor with an accurate analysis of your 
                symptoms to help them understand your illness and give you an accurate 
                diagnosis. There are no lab tests that can help identify dysthymia. 
                However, testing may be done in terms of blood work that will help your 
                doctor understand the state of any physical illnesses you may and have 
                also to rule out the possibility of drug effects that may be causing 
                dysthymia, prior to diagnosing one with persistent depressive disorder.</p><br>
            
                <h3><strong>The DSM-5 criteria for dysthymia</strong></h3>
                <p>The patient’s situation must match the diagnostic criteria listed in DSM-5 
                    for the doctor to diagnose them with the disorder. Some of those 
                    criteria include,</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Adults experiencing symptoms of depression for at least two years or more, and often.</li>
                    <li>Children experiencing depressive symptoms for at least one year.</li>
                    <li>Symptoms must be strong enough to result in messing with a 
                        person’s normal day-to-day function.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is also difficult for people to understand such long-lasting symptoms 
                    to be something they need to get help for and are more likely to dismiss 
                    them as a normal part of their lives. However, the faster the diagnosis 
                    is the faster a treatment plan can come into action, which means 
                    recovery is on the way.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">Risk factors relevant to persistent depressive disorder</h2>
            <p>Most of the risk factors become causes of dysthymia. Risk factors are what 
                makes you more vulnerable compared to those that do not have the risk 
                factors for developing a certain condition. Those with risk factors need 
                to be extra careful than those who are without.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Having a close relative who has a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder, 
                    major depressive disorder or any other form of a condition related to depression.</li>
                <li>Those who use drugs/substances or alcohol frequently</li>
                <li>Going through a traumatic life event, or having gone through one from which you 
                    haven’t quite recovered completely</li>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">Complications that accompany dysthymia</h2>
            <p>Not only does dysthymia stand in the way of someone spending a quality life, 
                but it also becomes responsible to come more complications as mentioned below.</p>
            <h4><strong>Mood disorders</strong></h4>
            <p>Persistent depressive disorder can make its victim vulnerable to changing moods that 
                are rapid and for no real reason.</p>
            
            <h4><strong>Substance abuse</strong></h4> 
            <p>Sometimes substance or drug abuse is generally associated with negative moods 
                and wanting to be happier. With dysthymia the patient is almost always likely 
                to be sad, depressed, criticizing themselves, feeling worthless and hopeless. 
                As much as drugs and substances can cause this disorder, it can also be the 
                other way around, there the effects of dysthymia pushes its victims to find 
                a temporary escape in intoxication.</p>
            
            <h4><strong>Interpersonal problems</strong></h4>
            <p>It is difficult to maintain successful relationships when you are always 
                looking at the negativities and find it difficult to be happy. Making happy 
                memories and generally uplifting the spirit plays a major role in a 
                successful relationship. Not being able to contribute to making such happy 
                memories can be the downfall of relationships.</p>

            <h4><strong>Productivity issues</strong></h4>
            <p>Persistent depressive disorder can take a severe effect on someone’s ability 
                to focus on a task. Due to the lack of concentration, performance, as well as 
                productivity, can drop in schoolwork or in the corporate sector. Without the 
                same level of focus, one can not perform the way one used to and can put 
                one off of their game.</p>

            <h4><strong>Pain and illnesses</strong></h4>
            <p>The pain and illnesses caused by dysthymia or are the cause of dysthymia 
                can generally make life uncomfortable for anyone. Especially because there 
                is no exact way to treat the issue, there can be good days and bad days in 
                the life of someone who has a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder.</p>

            <h4><strong>Self-harming tendencies</strong></h4>
            <p>Due to the contact negative outlook on life and the mental strain put forth by 
                other symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, those that are suffering may 
                try to harm or kill themselves. This is especially possible due to the fact that 
                they have succumbed to the idea of themselves being pessimistic people, not 
                understanding that the long-lasting symptoms are a treatable disorder. Thus, 
                they may not see a way out. This is also another reason why it is important 
                to reach out for help when the symptoms first start showing.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">Treating the persistent depressive disorder</h2>
            <p>As serious as persistent depressive disorder is, it is also a treatable problem.
                Not easy, but possible. The extent that treatment can really go is not 
                usually experienced by the patients because they usually visit one family 
                doctor who does not have a clear idea of what is happening. With time, 
                they will stop any and all complaints and get used to their pessimistic 
                life controlled by dysthymia. However, to those who decide to take the
                necessary steps to determine and real with what is wrong with them, life
                can be very much improved.</p>
            <p>Like any other mental health problem, persistent depressive disorder also 
                uses medication and psychotherapy as treatment methods.</p><br>
                
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-8">Psychotherapy</h2>
            <p>When it comes to psychotherapy (talk therapy), there are several techniques in 
                the process such as CBT, which focuses on identifying and altering underlying
                 pessimistic thought patterns into the positive side, which are usually 
                 the main cause of contribution towards depressive thoughts. IPT is also 
                 a part of psychotherapy and drives to identify issues in interpersonal 
                 relationships and in communication, helping the patient with improving 
                 such shortcomings.</p>
            <p>Therapy can help someone with many aspects that work towards an overall development 
                in their personality. Some benefits of therapy are,</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Finding and introducing better and healthy ways of expressing coping with emotions</li>
                <li>Helping individuals cope with their overwhelming emotions</li>
                <li>Better equipping people in ways that they can easily adjust to challenges and hardships in life</li>
                <li>Helping clients identifying what triggers them, aggravates them and pushes them to their limit 
                    and thus helping them take care of their mental health by teaching them what to avoid</li>
                <li>Working towards building positivity in people who only have a negative outlook on life</li>
                <li>Working on increasing a sense of empowerment and control by helping clients be self-confident</li>
                <li>Helping clients to establish goals and aims which are achievable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can participate in therapy individually or join a group. For more 
                information about this or to place an appointment with one of our clinicians, 
                get in touch with our friendly team at Epsychiatry who are looking forward
                to guiding you through the process.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-9">Prescribed medication</h2>
            <p>There are many different types of medications that help deal with depressive 
                symptoms. Sometimes they may take a few weeks to work up to their full effect, 
                so it is important to continue taking them at advice doses by your healthcare 
                provider. Sometimes, with the progress medicines may have to switch or 
                stopped. Make sure to not do any such changes without consulting your doctor 
                first. In addition, it is not wise to have many different pills for your 
                symptoms without visiting a doctor for treatment. This can happen with 
                dysthymia since many do not realize that their condition needs help. 
                Thus, if you are someone who has had the above symptoms and have been 
                taking many different medicines to deal with them, it may be time for 
                you to get a 
                <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/clinicians/">professional</a> opinion.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-10">Lifestyle changes</h2>
            <p>In addition to these clinical methods, lifestyle changes can also help one 
                make life easier dealing with persistent depressive disorder. The condition 
                is long term. With the medication and therapy, one must also focus on 
                staying active and fit enough to complement medical treatment as well as 
                face the symptoms better. If the body is weak and can not handle the
                pressure, there can be no improvement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting at least 7h of sleep. Making sure you get enough rest.</li>
                <li>Sticking to a healthy diet.</li>
                <li>Working out or engaging in activities at least three times a week.</li>
                <li>Reducing or completely stopping the usage of alcohol and drugs.</li>
                <li>Practising mindfulness-based activities such as yoga</li>
                <li>Meditating to ensure your mind is peaceful and calm</li>
                <li>Having a journal to open up about, vent, and track your progress</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You are in for a recovery journey that may take a while. It is your responsibility 
                to stick to the medication, therapy and a quality lifestyle to make sure the 
                recovery process is in no way slow or has disturbances. Also, make sure to ask 
                your doctor about any doubts you may have before you take the administered medication, 
                especially regarding the side effects.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-11">What does the future look like?</h2>
            <p>Persistent depressive disorder is popular as a chronic disease. This means 
                some people may never recover completely. However, it is possible to recover 
                and needs resilience, commitment and dedication towards the cause. 
                Even without being able to completely recover, treatment can still be 
                a very effective way to manage symptoms in order to brush up the quality 
                of one’s life. There can be times symptoms pop up when you least expect 
                them to.</p>

            <p>However, practising mindfulness which is a technique useful to strengthen 
                the mind can <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/contact-us/"> help</a> 
                one face these unexpected challenges with understanding 
                and patience.</p>
