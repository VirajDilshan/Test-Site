            <p>When you hear the term OCPD you may think you know what this means. A common 
                insight of this disorder is a person who is extremely neat or simply a person 
                who organizes his work. Throwaway phrases, such as “That’s so OCD”, can 
                underestimate the disorder as a character quirk that anyone can exhibit 
                on a whim. </p>
            <p>It is important to learn that Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and OCPD are 
                different disorders. In this article, we are going to discuss the diagnoses 
                of OCPD, the difference between OCD and OCPD, and the treatments that are 
                currently available. </p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">What is OCPD?</h2>
            <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder is defined by a persistent and rigid 
                fixation with organisation, extreme perfectionism, and maintaining control 
                in all situations. A person with OCPD will overlook the original goal of a 
                task they are doing in favour of perfecting the details of the task. 
                These personality traits typically hinder the individual in completing 
                ordinary daily errands and sustaining interpersonal relationships.</p>
            <p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
                (DSM-5), about 2% of us have OCPD. A 2018 report by SANE Australia also 
                estimated that OCD is the most common of all personality disorders.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">What is the difference between OCPD and OCD?</h2>
            <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder is often confused with the 
                well-known anxiety disorder OCD.</p>
            <p>People with OCD have unwanted and irrational thoughts that drive them to 
                repetitive behaviours i.e. compulsions such as counting numbers/actions, 
                ritualised handwashing and repeatedly checking door locks/car locks. 
                Completing these compulsions helps to dispel anxious feelings and 
                thoughts, however, the person is likely aware that their compulsions 
                are unrealistic and can feel distressed as a result.</p>
            <p>In contrast to this, a person with OCPD does not have these compulsions, but 
                instead an inflexible view of life and adherence to extreme standards. This 
                on its own is not a negative, and many people with OCPD may excel in their 
                careers due to their level of focus; however, they will persist with their 
                rigid routines even if it is negatively impacting their lives. They are not 
                known to be described as approachable or relaxed, and their inflexibility 
                and obsession with details tend to lead to difficulty in maintaining 
                relationships and a display of perceived antisocial behaviour.</p>
            <p>People with OCPD are steadfast in their beliefs and fully resolved that their 
                actions are “right”. They are often quick to anger when someone disagrees 
                with them and may feel the need to impose their views on those around them. 
                They have no awareness that their habits may be negatively impacting their 
                efficiency in work or engagement in relationships.</p>
            <p>There is currently no known cause of OCPD, however, it is suspected 
                to be a combination of cultural norms, childhood experiences and genetics.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">What are personality disorders?</h2>
            <p>Briefly, personality disorders are long-standing behaviours, ways of operating 
                and seeing and understanding the world around us which are different from 
                most other people. Generally, these ways of thinking and functioning are 
                quite rigid and cause problems in various ways for the person and those 
                around them. OCPD is considered to be one type of personality disorder.</p><br>            

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">What are the signs and symptoms of OCPD?</h2>
            <p>A person with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder may present 
                with behaviours such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive list-making and schedule planning</li>
                <li>Rigid adherence to rules that others would consider insignificant</li>
                <li>An extreme need to be punctual</li>
                <li>Formal or stiff mannerisms that may appear as antisocial</li>
                <li>Obsessing over minor details of a task so much so that it is left unfinished</li>
                <li>Hoarding or an unwillingness to throw out ruined and worthless objects</li>
                <li>A refusal to delegate tasks as others may not do the task the “right way”</li>
                <li>An excessive devotion to work in place of engaging in social relationships</li>
                <li>A belief that everything will be fine if things are done the way 
                    they perceive they should be</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You do not need to present with all the symptoms listed above to be diagnosed
                but will likely exhibit a consistent pattern of three or four of the behaviours. 
                The typical onset of these symptoms is late adolescence to early adulthood.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">How is OCPD diagnosed?</h2>
            <p>A clinical diagnosis of OCPD can be made when a pattern of certain behaviours 
                results in a substantial negative impact on the person’s work life, 
                social life, and familial relationships.</p>
            <p>While there isn’t a specific physical test, such as taking a blood sample, 
                a doctor can speak to a person about their behaviour and how they feel this 
                is affecting their life. The doctor may also need to speak to the person’s 
                close relatives or friends to accurately assess their day-to-day actions.</p>
            <p>Counselling sessions may also prove useful to the diagnosis of OCPD. After a 
                few counselling sessions, a referral to the doctor may be recommended if 
                there is a presenting suspicion of OCPD.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">How does Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder affect relationships?</h2>
            <p>How you interact with others on a regular basis and your social circle is a 
                strong clinical indicator of OCPD. A relationship, whether it be familial, 
                friendly, or romantic, is not a priority for someone with OCPD. They prefer 
                to focus on getting things done the correct way and this often stands in 
                the way of maintaining their relationships.</p>
            <p>Having a loved one with OCPD can be difficult. They may be overly critical, 
                want to take control of every situation and be unwilling to hear other 
                opinions on how things should be done. On the other hand, they can also be 
                driven and hardworking, and this can help to repair the relationships when 
                their strengths are focused on the right place.</p>
            <p>As someone with OCPD is so preoccupied with the minute details of daily life, 
                they have little recognition of their own feelings and the feelings of 
                others. This means open communication with their partners does not come 
                naturally to them and they may not understand why their partner is upset 
                with them or how to resolve it. They may appear to be indifferent at times, 
                and neglectful of their loved ones.</p>
            <p>As the person with OCPD may not feel they need to change, improvements to 
                their relationships can only be made through seeking and participating in 
                treatments. At Epsychiatry, the benefits of family consultations will be 
                discussed with you in order to involve your loved ones in your treatment 
                of care.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">What treatments are available?</h2>
            <p>It is common for a person with OCPD to be unaware that they require 
                treatment and it can take a significant life change or perhaps, the 
                encouragement of a loved one to motivate them to seek help</p>
            <p>Once appropriately motivated, there is a range of treatments for OCPD:</p>
            
            <h4><strong>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a practical approach to treating a 
                wide range of mental health disorders. The premise for this therapy is that 
                strong emotions can be challenging to change direction, so the therapy 
                works on changing the negative thoughts and actions that 
                lead to these emotions. CBT relies on the mind-body connection, 
                meaning that a person’s thoughts, emotions, actions, and physical 
                experiences are all interlinked. The aim is to interrupt the negative 
                thought cycle, which in turn leads to negative feelings and 
                physical symptoms.</p>
            <p>In comparison to traditional talk therapy, CBT concentrates on specific 
                problems and uses a goal-orientated approach over a short period to combat 
                these concerns. CBT is usually structured over 6-8 weeks, although this can 
                vary from patient to patient, and will be decided between the individual 
                and their therapist in the initial session.</p>
            <p>A typical CBT session involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identifying a current problem that is causing stress</li>
                <li>Recognising the thoughts and feelings that relate to this problem</li>
                <li>Identifying unreasonable and inaccurate perceptions</li>
                <li>Reshaping this perception</li>
            </ol>
            <p>CBT can be particularly effective for Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder 
                because the person likely has inflexible and stubborn beliefs that can take 
                much longer to overcome through talking therapy. Think of CBT as a 
                high-intensity treatment over a short period, with clear goals to be 
                reached at the end. This approach can be attractive to people with OCPD 
                as they are generally extremely focused and enjoy detailed plans.</p>

            <h4><strong>Traditional Talk Therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>Talk therapy is an industry standard when it comes to the treatment of mental 
                health disorders. Studies have shown that this form of therapy can help 
                alleviate negative thoughts and feelings through expressing your worries 
                about distressing life events or general mental health 
                concerns you may have.</p>
            <p>Talk therapy involves seeking out or being referred to a licenced professional 
                therapist. You will meet with your chosen therapist for an initial session 
                where they will guide you to discuss the underlying reason why you are 
                seeking therapy and what outcome you would like to achieve.</p>
            <p>Professional therapists are trained active listeners, and this helps the 
                patient to feel that what they are saying is important and that they are 
                valued as a person. Talk therapy gives each patient the opportunity to 
                explore the root of their negative thoughts and how this can have a 
                knock-on effect on a person’s mood and behaviour.</p>
            <p>A therapist can also give gentle advice on techniques that can combat the 
                negative thought-action cycle that may be occurring. This can be invaluable 
                to patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder if they are 
                willing to fully commit to the therapy by being open and honest and accepting 
                the advice that is given. Talk therapy can also be advised in combination 
                with a variety of other treatments.</p>
            <h4><strong>Prescribed Medications</strong></h4>
            <p>Your doctor may discuss with you the possibility of trailing prescribed 
                medications to treat Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. They are 
                more likely to prescribe medication if there is also a co-occurring 
                depression or anxiety disorder along with OCPD.</p>
            <p>SSRIs treat the symptoms of OCPD by increasing the levels of serotonin in 
                the brain. Serotonin often called the “happy hormone”, is known to naturally 
                stabilize your mood and help you feel happier, calmer, and less anxious. 
                Many studies have shown that a deficiency in serotonin is associated with 
                depression, anxiety, and a variety of personality disorders.</p>
            <p>Medication is not the first line of treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive 
                Personality Disorder, and doctors typically prefer to advise this in 
                cases where other therapies have proved ineffective or there is a 
                co-occurring depressive or anxiety disorder. You should discuss all your 
                options with your doctor in order to make an informed decision.</p>
            <h4><strong>Relaxation Techniques </strong></h4>
            <p>Specific relaxation techniques have also proved useful in treating the 
                symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. The most universal 
                technique that is suggested by healthcare providers is called Progressive 
                Muscle Relaxation (PMR).</p>
            <p>This technique guides you to tighten and relax your muscles in a particular 
                order so that you may recognise where you are holding tension in the body 
                and work to release this tension. The idea is that you can relax your body 
                gradually by tensing and releasing the muscle groups. When performed 
                regularly, PMR has been shown to relieve the physical symptoms of OCPD, 
                as well as many other benefits such as regulating blood pressure and an 
                improved sleep cycle.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-8">What is the prognosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?</h2>
            <p>At present, there few studies of adequate scale to adequately assess the 
                prognosis of a person with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder who 
                is receiving treatment. The treatments are promising; however, a lack of 
                self-awareness and the presence of co-morbidities can act as a barrier to 
                treatment.</p>
            <p>While the treatments appear effective, it is evident that it may take 
                significant time to see results. Therefore, the sooner treatment is 
                prescribed, the better the prognosis.</p>
            <p>If you suspect that you or a loved one may have Obsessive-Compulsive 
                Personality Disorder, you should 
                <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/contact-us/">arrange to speak</a> to a medical professional 
                as soon as possible to discuss the treatment options.</p>
            <p>You can be referred to a 
                <a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/clinicians/">psychiatrist</a> or psychologist at Epsychiatry for an
                 assessment and possible treatment. Speak with your GP for a referral.</p>
