            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">Avoidant Personality Disorder</h2>
            <p>Feeling shy around other people is normal. Usually, avoidant personality 
                disorder means that we are aware of others and our environment. Most of us 
                experience being in a room full of people we don’t know. For example on
                 our first day of school or a new workplace. Eventually, we learn to 
                 manage on our own. It is also normal to have days when we want to 
                 withdraw from social interactions entirely. Sometimes we prefer our 
                 own company, or we are simply not social butterflies like other people.</p><br>
            <p>However, it becomes a problem when this behaviour becomes the default 
                coping mechanism for every social encounter. Thereafter it starts 
                affecting how we work, our relationships, and how we perceive others.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">Avoidant Personality Disorder vs Shyness/Social Awkwardness</h2>
            <h4><strong>Shyness vs Avoidant Personality Disorder</strong></h4>
            <p>Do you have a friend who cancels plans or refuses to go out because they 
                prefer to be by themselves? What about when someone is noticeably quiet when 
                they go to parties or meet new people? All of these can be normal responses 
                to new situations. It’s difficult meeting strangers and getting to know them. 
                Why? Because we don’t know what kind of person they are yet, especially 
                when you are the type of person who feels happier in their own company.</p>
            <p>People can be shy around strangers. However,  with their friends. They act 
                as if that shyness had never existed, to begin with. They’re capable of 
                feeling comfortable around their friends. They have no trouble making new 
                ones after getting past their first hesitations. Some people are even more 
                prone to fumble in social interactions than others and act awkward. 
                However, they brush it off. It would not stop them from trying to make 
                new friends.</p>
            <p>This is different from Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD). You would find 
                yourself withdrawing from others. Believing that it would be better to avoid 
                people entirely rather than experience being rejected. You may even 
                believe you may not be enough for others to accept you and stop trying. 
                Despite people acting otherwise. It can be hard living with AVPD 
                because even if you want to build relationships with others, your 
                negative thoughts about yourself and fears stop you from doing so.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">Signs & Symptoms in Avoidant Personality Disorder</h2>
            <h4>But it is reasonable to consider the diagnosis if you or someone you know 
                presents with the following characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overly sensitive towards criticism, whether it is constructive or not</li>
                    <li>Has a select few friends, and scared of making more unless they are sure 
                        they will not be rejected</li>
                    <li>Wants companionship but withdraws themselves due to their fear of 
                        rejection or feelings of inadequacy</li>
                    <li>Cannot deepen relationships with people due to fears of shame and ridicule</li>
                    <li>Avoids social settings, or any event involving other people</li>
                    <li>Exaggerates or catastrophizes potential problems in social encounters</li>
                    <li>Associated with terms like “People pleasers” or “Inferiority Complex”</li>
                    <li>Poor self-image and overly conscious in social situations</li>
                </ul><br>            

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">How would someone with Avoidant Personality Disorder think?</h2>
            <h4><strong>Social Cognition</strong></h4>
            <p>Mentalization is the ability of someone to read into what drives other 
                peoples’ behaviour and emotions. They would experience deficits in 
                mentalization, causing them to misconstrue other people’s intentions, 
                thus affecting their self-esteem and social skills. They also have deficits 
                in their ability to be aware of, regulate, and express their emotions, 
                called affect consciousness. Because of this, they try to protect themselves 
                from emotional pain by avoiding emotions entirely. Ultimately, their 
                skewed social cognition makes them more conscious of themselves and how 
                people see them. In addition, they are less self-reflective of their 
                thoughts and actions.</p>

            <h4><strong>Self-concept</strong> </h4>
            <p>After repeated instances of disappointing relationships, we can often think 
                maybe we are the problem. In addition, failed relationships with others 
                can leave us thinking less of ourselves. This is a common thought. 
                People with avoidant personality disorder present with “malignant 
                self-regard”. Which means they may present with masochistic, 
                self-defeating, and depressive personality styles. More than 
                low self-esteem, they experience a sense of personal inadequacy.</p>

            <h4><strong>Fear of Rejection</strong></h4>
            <p>Being rejected can feel like one of the most heartbreaking experiences 
                for people. So it is only natural we would want to avoid it. However, 
                that fear of rejection can be used in a way that suppresses emotional 
                expression. This happens for people with an avoidant personality disorder. 
                Others however view it as a sign that they are not interested or 
                lacking in compassion. This, as a result, increases the risk of rejection 
                by others and the cycle repeats itself.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">Causes of Avoidant Personality Disorder</h2>
            <p>There are different theories of personality involved when it comes to finding 
                the cause of a mental disorder. Many of them are biopsychosocial in nature. 
                Meaning that it is physical, psychological, and social factors that 
                affect the development of mental disorders. For Avoidant Personality 
                Disorder, it can be divided into four factors:</p>

            <h4><strong> Early childhood experiences</strong></h4>
            <p>The way you were raised can affect how your personality develops later in life. 
                Children’s thoughts and beliefs are easily moulded by caregivers with who 
                they interact within their growing years. This can be their parents, 
                grandparents, or teachers. Studies have shown that caregivers who are 
                less affectionate and encouraging of achievements, were more likely 
                to raise children who develop an avoidant personality disorder.  
                Secondly, parents who were more rejecting and guilt-engendering were 
                also likely to raise children with these traits. </p>
            <p>While parents who are neglectful and abusive (emotionally and/or physically)
                 can increase the chance of developing AVPD. In addition, those who are 
                 overprotective can also contribute to AVPD. That is because both of 
                 these upbringings build the idea in their children that they need to 
                 suppress their own wants. that they need to avoid negative consequences 
                 like abuse.</p>
            <h4><strong>Attachment style</strong></h4>
            <p>Attachment styles are how people handle their relationships with others. 
                It is based on how they were treated in their childhood by their main 
                caregiver. These styles can manifest all the way into adulthood, 
                regardless of whether they are constructive or not. An avoidant attachment 
                style contributes to the incidence of AVPD. Partly due to its 
                association with the development of negative self-concepts and
                 fear of intimate relationships.</p>
            <p>But there is also a fearful attachment style that promotes a desire for 
                intimate relationships but a feeling of distrust and fear of rejection. 
                This is characteristic in people with AVPD. It has also been shown to 
                be the most disabling. It is associated with negative feelings towards 
                the self and other people. If early caregivers are critical, demeaning, 
                and neglectful, it may teach the child that other people will treat 
                them the same way. Thus affecting their relationships with other people.</p>
            <h4><strong>Temperamental factors</strong></h4>
            <p>Some temperaments make people susceptible to developing AVPD. They refer to a 
                person’s natural inclination towards specific behaviours not influenced by their 
                learning, values, and attitudes. They can increase a child’s vulnerability towards 
                avoidant coping mechanisms and even put them at risk for negative childhood 
                experiences. The temperaments founded to be connected to AVPD include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personality rigidity</li>
                <li>Hypersensitivity</li>
                <li>High harm avoidance</li>
                <li>Low novelty-seeking</li>
                <li>Overactive behavioural inhibition system</li>
                <li>Moody or easily agitated</li>
                <li>Shyness</li>
                <li>Low social approach & high social avoidance</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h4><strong>Genetic factors</strong></h4>
            <p>Genetic studies suggest that heredity can play a part in developing AVPD. 
                But while you may be biologically predisposed to AVPD, the chances of 
                symptoms manifesting are low. Environmental factors together with genetics 
                bring about the coping mechanisms relating to AVPD.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">Avoidant Personality Disorder Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>There are no laboratory tests for diagnosing personality disorders. The 5th 
                edition of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
                (DSM-5 criteria) makes the diagnosis of AVPD. The most important and distinct 
                symptoms present in AVPD are feelings of inadequacy. Secondly, the fear of 
                rejection, and thirdly social inhibition.</p>
            <h4><strong>Symptoms</strong></h4>
            <p>People with avoidant personality disorder are usually diagnosed as adults 
                because children are usually still forming their personalities. 
                They may still have time to outgrow their behaviours. Some 
                psychologists make use of validated and reliable assessment questionnaires. 
                These help accurately test whether your symptoms match those required to 
                diagnose Avoidant Personality Disorder.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">Avoidant Personality Disorder Treatment</h2>
            <p>Many people with symptoms of avoidant personality disorder do not seek help. 
                unless they begin experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety. 
                It is also likely they will stop treatment once those symptoms alleviate. 
                Like other personality disorders, they often are not aware that their 
                behaviour is a problem.</p>
            <p>Avoidant Personality Disorder treatment involves mostly psychotherapy rather 
                than prescribed medications. Unless you are experiencing comorbid disorders 
                or debilitating symptoms like anxiety and depression. If medications are 
                involved, they must be coupled with psychotherapy. This is because the root 
                of the problem lies in their deep-rooted thoughts and subsequent behaviours.</p><br>
            <h4><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong></h4> 
            <p>CBT is one of the most widely-used therapies for people with personality disorders. 
                As the name “cognitive-behavioural” suggests. It aims to change unhealthy thinking
                 patterns and change coping behaviours. Both of which are at the root of personality 
                 disorders. For avoidant personality disorder, you can do it individually, in groups,
                 or both if deemed necessary.</p>
            <p>For individual CBT, a more cognitive approach is useful. This is under the 
                basis that your behavioural problems are based on dysfunctional thought 
                processes and irrational belief systems. This involves cognitive 
                restructuring, where you and the therapist will identify irrational 
                or maladaptive thoughts together, then work to accept a rational 
                conclusion.</p>
            <p>There is also group CBT that will have a more behavioural approach. 
                This is to take advantage of the presence of other people in the group. 
                This involves gradual exposure, where you need encouragement to take on 
                situations you normally avoid. Also, social skills training, where you will
                 discuss and practice interacting with others appropriately and effectively.</p>
            <h4><strong>Psychodynamic Therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>Psychodynamic therapy places emphasis on the root of negative thinking. 
                It does so by bringing to light events from the past that have caused pain 
                and conflict for people with personality disorders. This would allow you to 
                become more self-aware of the causes of your symptoms and rationalize where 
                they arise from. This type of therapy focuses on five important concepts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Affect and emotion</li>
                    <li>Past experiences</li>
                    <li>Patterns and themes of relationships</li>
                    <li>Relationship between the client and therapist</li>
                    <li>Transference and resistance within the client-therapist relationship</li>
                </ol>
            <p>One of the most characteristic parts of psychodynamic therapy is the last 
                two concepts. Primarily, because it recognizes that clients tend to place 
                their feelings about their significant relationships onto the therapist, 
                whether they know it or not. For example, if you view others with distrust 
                and fear of rejection, you would view the therapist the same way at first. 
                This allows the therapist to give you a new experience through the 
                relationship you’ll build together. So that you can generalize it with other 
                interpersonal relationships in the future.</p>
            <h4><strong>Schema Therapy</strong></h4>
            <p>This therapy builds on CBT and other therapies while focusing on the 
                therapist-client relationship. The aim of this therapy is to improve 
                daily functioning through behaviour. Also, similar to CBT, while addressing 
                their misconstructions of previous experiences like psychodynamic therapy. 
                A key feature here involves “limited reparenting” wherein the client learns 
                four concepts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How dysfunctional schemas are repeated throughout their life</li>
                <li>Coping styles they learned in their childhood</li>
                <li>Schema modes (i.e., mindset and coping styles) being used for coping
                     and how they cause more harm than good</li>
                <li>Developing better coping skills and meeting emotional needs</li>
            </ol><br>
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-8">Relationship with…</h2>
            <h4><strong>Schizoid Personality Disorder </strong></h4>
            <p>Although commonly mistaken for the other, the stark contrast between 
                schizoid and avoidant personality disorder is that people with the 
                former have no interest in dealing with others, while those with the 
                latter long for companionship.</p>
            <h4><strong>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) </strong></h4>
            <p>This is another diagnosis mistaken for avoidant personality disorder but can 
                exist comorbidly. While both involve social interactions. People with social 
                anxiety disorder however have the fear of embarrassing themselves when 
                performing in front of others. “Performing” can refer to even normal social 
                interactions where they can embarrass themselves. People with avoidant 
                personality disorder, however, have hypersensitivity towards being rejected 
                by others. Both SAD and AVPD can be present in a person.</p>
            <h4><strong>Depression </strong></h4>
            <p>This is a common disorder present in people with AVPD and is associated with 
                higher chances of suicidal ideation and attempts making AVPD a predictor 
                for chronic depression. In the same way, both disorders are a result of 
                maladaptive coping behaviours. In addition, they also promote the cycle 
                of negative thoughts and self-concepts.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-9">How can a psychologist, psychiatrist, 
                or mental health professional help?</h2>
            <h4><strong>How can Psychologists and Psychiatrists help you?</strong></h4>
            <p><a href="https://epsychiatry.com.au/clinicians/">Psychologists</a> and psychiatrists are trained to provide psychotherapy to 
                their clients and address their cognitive, behavioural, and social concerns 
                associated with various mental disorders. They can diagnose avoidant 
                personality disorder and treat it with appropriate therapies. They can 
                also help you understand the cognitive, behavioural, and social factors 
                that affect your condition. Also, bring to light coping strategies and skills 
                specifically made for you and your condition.</p>
            <p>Sometimes there are underlying disorders such as depression or anxiety that 
                are exacerbating the client’s symptoms. A psychiatrist will be helpful in 
                providing medications for those comorbid disorders. A psychiatrist, as a 
                medical doctor, can provide insight as to the connection between physical 
                and mental health.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes, treatment will involve the cooperation of friends, family, 
                and other circles of support for the client. This will educate you about 
                your condition. As well as how to guide you in your recovery and compliance 
                to your course of treatment. </p>
            <h4><strong>Prevention</strong></h4>
            <p>Unlike physical ailments, mental disorders can be hard to prevent because 
                usually, their root cause stems from events in the past that can no longer 
                be changed. What can be changed, however, is our awareness of these symptoms. 
                If you or anyone you care about presents with these kinds of thoughts and 
                behaviours. It may be helpful to seek early treatment for a better outcome.</p>
