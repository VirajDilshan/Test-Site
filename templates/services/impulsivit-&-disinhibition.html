            <p>Impulsivity & Disinhibition can get the better of us at times. It happens 
                when we want something bad enough or forget to think before we act. This 
                is more common when we’re kids. We want the latest toys or the best tasting 
                food, and cry when we don’t get it. But as we grow older, we learn to 
                suppress our wants. Later on, we even start to consider people, context, 
                and other factors before we act. But this impulsivity can develop into 
                something more harmful. Where we normally think about our decisions, it 
                can be hard for some people because of disinhibition. This means that we 
                immediately react with no plan or regard for the outcomes. This can be a 
                sign of a possible mental disorder. Many people with these disorders are 
                likely to do risky behaviours, pushing them to seek help.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">What is impulsivity & Disinhibition?</h2>
            <p>Some of us may know about the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment. For those who 
                don’t, it was an experiment done in 1972 by Prof. Walter Mischel from 
                Stanford University. The experiment involved kids sitting alone in a room 
                with a marshmallow. These kids were told that if they don’t eat the 
                marshmallow until the researcher comes back, they can have two marshmallows. 
                This study was about immediate gratification. Immediate gratification 
                refers to how we are tempted to do something right away for a faster reward. 
                The study showed that kids who did not seek immediate gratification had 
                more successes. They had higher academic scores, healthier bodies, and other 
                life measures. There is functional impulsivity. This is when acting without 
                thinking can be appropriate and even beneficial. Immediate gratification is 
                one of our most basic drives to seek pleasure and avoid pain. So, it’s normal 
                Having good reflexes during fights or being able to resolve problems 
                quickly can be examples of these. There will be times in our lives where 
                we have to act or lose something. An extreme example can be saving someone 
                from a moving car. We may not immediately think of the future outcomes. 
                But what kicks in is our sense of right or wrong. Although impulsivity & 
                Disinhibition is common in children, their ability to a tendency towards 
                immediate gratification can help predict their future. Even as adults, 
                we should know better. When impulsivity gets the best of us so we get 
                into vices, cheat our diets, or hit the snooze button of our alarms. 
                This may not really lead to bad life choices because these behaviours 
                are common. Most of the time, we can stop ourselves from acting on our 
                wants for a long-term goal. But what if we lost the ability to do so 
                completely?</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">When does impulsivity become a problem?</h2>
            <p>Dysfunctional impulsivity refers to acting with less thought compared to 
                those of the same skill and knowledge. You wouldn’t expect a 25-year-old 
                man to be as impulsive as a 5-year-old child. It was also theorized that 
                there are 3 aspects to impulsivity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motor</strong> – action without thinking, at the spur of the moment</li>
                <li><strong>Inattentiveness</strong> – not focusing on the task</li>
                <li><strong>Non-planning</strong> – acting without thinking carefully</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the DSM-5, impulsivity is related to disinhibition. This is because 
                impulsive people lack the ability to inhibit their need for immediate 
                gratification and act on it. Planning is a needed skill for decision making 
                because our decisions tend to affect others. People could get hurt by our 
                decisions if we act on impulse all the time. It may even harm the person 
                acting on impulse. That is why it is important to stop and consider all 
                factors affecting our decisions.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">Why are some people impulsive?</h2>
            <h4><strong>Cognitive Factors of Impulsivity & Disinhibition</strong></h4>
            <p>From a cognitive perspective, people who are impulsive make decisions different 
                from others. They can’t control nor wait for rewards themselves. As a result, 
                they would rather take a quicker reward. Even though it will lead to negative 
                results in the long run or it is of less value. For them, the best rewards are 
                those that are given right away. But it’s the opposite when it comes to 
                punishments. They prefer bigger delayed penalties over smaller later ones. 
                If you were to ask them to think about future outcomes, they would be unable 
                to do so. To them, there’s more uncertainty in the future. Whereas, 
                immediate rewards are more likely to be received. This is similar to how 
                we think “when will this opportunity come again?” It makes sense to think 
                that many things can happen between now and the delayed reward. So, they 
                would rather be rewarded now. An important driving factor is fears. For 
                example, Some people are scared of losing things they care about. As a 
                result, people become defensive to avoid losing them. Another example 
                is when someone is scared of being left behind, they will find ways to 
                cling to people. Even if these actions will harm themselves or other 
                people. For them, it doesn’t matter. Anything would be better than 
                being left behind. Just the anxiety caused by the possibility of 
                being left behind will push them to act without thinking.</p><br>

            <h4><strong>Social Factors of Impulsivity & Disinhibition</strong></h4>
            <p>It is an unfortunate reality that we are all born into different situations. 
                The culture of one person can be different from another. When it comes to 
                impulsivity, culture and upbringing play a big role. Poverty can influence 
                impulsive behaviours. This is because they live lacking basic needs, like 
                food, clean water, and shelter. Their health may be at risk if they waited 
                for basic needs. So, their decision-making will lean more towards immediate 
                rewards. People who grew up with parents who had poor impulse control are 
                also more likely to grow up the same way. Abusive, alcoholic, or anti-social 
                parents are still models for kids to learn from. Since most of their early 
                interactions are with their parents, they mostly learn from these behaviours. 
                Because of that, poor impulse control is all they know. If these problems 
                persist into adolescence, it will get harder to change these behaviours. 
                It’s harder to correct bad habits that are learned since childhood. This 
                emphasizes the importance of good parenting behaviours. Your actions not 
                only affect you but also your kids.</p><br>

            <h4><strong>Biological Factors of Impulsivity & Disinhibition</strong></h4>
            <p>Most mental disorders have a connection to our own bodies. Mental problems 
                can cause physical problems and vice versa. Studies have shown that there is 
                a part of the brain for inhibiting risky impulses. But these parts of the 
                brain a dysfunctional in those with impulsivity & Disinhibition. This makes 
                it mentally hard for them to think about what happens after the present. It 
                could be the connections in that brain are different from others. But this 
                field needs to be studied further. Chemicals in the brain associated with 
                reward pathways also cause impulsivity. These are related to people who use 
                too many drugs and alcohol because of the direct effect these substances 
                have on the brain. As a result, their brains are conditioned to feel positive, 
                immediate pleasure after use. These vices are used repeatedly because it 
                feels good, despite users knowing the negative effects it has on their lives. 
                Even hormones play a part in impulse control. Some hormones, like testosterone,
                 are linked to aggression and violence. Hormones that are imbalanced can also 
                 cause mood swings, adding to impulsive behaviour.</p><br>            

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">Associated mental disorders</h2>
            <h4><strong>Bipolar Disorder</strong></h4>
            <p>Those with bipolar disorder suffer from episodes of depression and mania. In 
                mania, impulsivity & Disinhibition is part of their major features. They act 
                without thinking, for the pleasure of it. If they don’t act out, they feel a 
                sense of anxiety. People in manic episodes lose focus on their tasks. To them, 
                it seems more important to do what they want to do right here, right now. This 
                often leads them to perform risky behaviours such as drug use, getting into 
                fights, and even doing self-harm. So if you have anyone you know who is going 
                through a manic episode, it is important to stay with them. Much of the time, 
                they cannot think before they act. Thus, it puts them and the people around 
                them at risk.</p><br>

            <h4><strong>Eating Disorder</strong></h4>
            <p>People with eating disorders also show impulsive behaviours. Heavily linked to 
                anxiety, people with eating disorders act on their anxieties before anything 
                else. Even when they know that their behaviours are harming their body 
                physically and mentally. As a result, they get the urge to binge or purge 
                food. Usually, this stems from the fear that they may be fat or faulty 
                coping styles. Eventually, binging and purging becomes a habit.</p><br>

            <p>The most commonly associated personality disorder with impulsivity is
                    borderline personality disorder (BPD). Impulsivity is a large part of BPD. 
                    As a result, they take part in risky behaviours. They start fights over 
                    small things, use vices, and even self-injury. People with BPD can’t stop 
                    their harmful behaviours because they rarely think about it. For them, the 
                    world is dangerous and hostile. So they act by those beliefs. They don’t 
                    really consider that their behaviour hurts them or others. This is because 
                    they lack the emotional empathy needed for insight.</p><br>

                <h4><strong>Substance Abuse</strong></h4>
                <p>Substance abuse can span from illegal drugs to alcohol use. As long as they 
                    develop a dependence on these vices, and act on these urges, they are may 
                    already be abusing substances. Because of the nature of the drugs they 
                    take, they achieve immediate pleasure. This starts out as a compulsion 
                    first. Then they become obsessed with finding their next dose. Despite 
                    knowing that the drugs they’re taking may be harmful, they still actively 
                    take them. If they cannot take them, they will do whatever they can to 
                    procure it. Even if it means hurting others or breaking the law in the 
                    process.</p><br>

                <h4><strong>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</strong></h4>
                <p>Usually diagnosed at a young age, ADHD is a disorder that people deal with 
                    for life. It is as the name implies: they have low attention spans but 
                    high activity. Impulsivity & Disinhibition is a big part of this disorder. 
                    Although impulsivity is common in kids, their impulsivity stays until 
                    their adults. Kids who have a hard time paying attention and sitting 
                    still may have ADHD. When they can’t get what they want, they throw 
                    tantrums. They get into fights with other kids and blurt out whatever 
                    they think. While these may seem common in kids, those with ADHD have 
                    it to the point their grades drop. They become unmotivated and sometimes 
                    aggressive. Their impulsivity becomes a disorder when it impedes their 
                    basic functioning.</p><br>

                <h4><strong>Impulse-Control Disorders</strong></h4>
                <p>These disorders are mostly related to compulsive behaviours. One of these 
                    disorders is pyromania, where a person likes settings things on fire. 
                    Kleptomania is another example, where a person likes stealing things. 
                    Even anger management problems like an intermittent explosive disorder 
                    where bursts of misplaced aggression occur. Many of these disorders 
                    present with poor impulse and compulsive behaviour. People with these 
                    disorders can’t help but act on their emotions. If they don’t, there’s 
                    an uncomfortable sensation of tension they’ll want to remove even if it 
                    hurts themselves or others. Even then, these people tend to feel guilty 
                    about their actions. This feeling usually pushes them to seek help.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">Self-management for impulsivity & Disinhibition</h2>
            <p>For people who are naturally impulsive, self-management can be a hard task. 
                But if you are willing to work hard and have the right sources of support, 
                you can learn to be more careful with the things you do. The first step is 
                to be aware of why you act this way. Is it because you’re impatient? What 
                about how your parents raised you? How do you see the world? Many of the 
                factors we talked about earlier can all contribute to your behaviour. It 
                may not have been your fault, but it is your responsibility to correct it. 
                Learning to stop and think is usually a good place to start. You may have 
                heard the term “look before you leap”. But this advice can be easier said 
                than done. Your emotions can be overwhelming and you will feel the need to 
                act now. Even if that’s the case, you need to make a habit of thinking about 
                others. Everything we do affects someone else in some way. So it’s important 
                to think about others when making decisions. Another thing to think about 
                is future outcomes. It helps to think of all the facts and where your 
                actions will lead. If you have a hard time with this, it would help to 
                get a second opinion. You can call a friend or an expert before you make 
                big decisions. Although it can tedious, know that it will be worth it.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">How can a mental health professional help?</h2>
            <p>Normally, impulsive behaviour wouldn’t need treatment. But when it begins 
                affecting your or someone else’s life, it might be time to seek help. Mental 
                health professionals, like therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists can 
                give therapy. These professionals can help bring to light the possible 
                factors leading to impulsive behaviour. A common therapy used to impulse 
                control disorders is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. In this therapy, the 
                client tries to identify what causes your behaviour. Then, the therapist 
                and client figure out proper strategies. It tackles the cognitive factors 
                associated with impulse behaviour in order to correct it. The therapist 
                can also get the help of friends and family. Sources of support are a big 
                part of the therapy process because they can act as a helping hand when 
                things get hard. They can also make sure the client is following their set 
                plans during the course of therapy, and see if they’re getting better. 
                Usually, it’s the people around you who have a big influence on your 
                behaviour. Another important job of the therapist is to check if you 
                have any mental disorder. They can diagnose and treat these disorders. 
                A psychiatrist can prescribe drugs you might need. For people with 
                trouble focusing, they can give Ritalin and other stimulants. It was 
                studied that anti-depressants can help, but more research is needed for 
                this. They can also give drugs if the client might have a mental 
                disorder causing their behaviour.</p>
