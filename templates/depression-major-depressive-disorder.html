            <p>When bad vibes take over one’s life to a point that you no longer remember how 
                it has first begun, you may feel like you are depressed. Depression is so 
                common and commonly known among people that most people take mild signs of 
                stress as depression. Most of the time, it is not as bad as depression or 
                otherwise known as major depressive disorder. How exactly will you recognize 
                depression or major depressive disorder? What can you do about it?</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-1">What is Major Depressive Disorder?</h2>
            <p>Major depressive disorder, otherwise known as depression is a mood disorder. 
                It is a common but also a very serious situation. The symptoms of Major 
                Depressive Disorder affects thinking, decision making and the general 
                quality of life. Those with depression find it difficult to enjoy life 
                and be happy. In other words, it becomes a significant part of one’s 
                life and affects the overall function, negatively. Some of the daily 
                happenings that might not function properly by depression due to 
                depression are eating, sleeping, walking, concentration, energy, mood, 
                happiness, positivity, etc. If these situations persist without treatment, 
                situations are common where depressed individuals seek suicide.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-2">Different forms of depression</h2>
            <p>There are different types of depression, based on the time they have lasted, 
                the symptoms and other factors.</p><br>
            <h3><strong>Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)</strong></h3>
            <p>A depression-related state that has been so without a change for at least 
                two years can be diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. A person 
                diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder may experience events of 
                significant and noticeable depression as well as times when the symptoms 
                are much less severe in effect. However, to be diagnosed with this disorder, 
                the symptoms should have remained for at least two years.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Postpartum Depression</strong></h3>
                
            <p>Mild depression during pregnancy and after giving birth is normal. This can 
                take place due to the rapid body changes, mood changes and all the new 
                challenges including anxiety about childbirth and the incoming new life. 
                However, Postpartum depression is not that. Some women experience major 
                depression just after they give birth, making them unsuccessful carers to 
                their newborns and even to themselves. This depression can take place either 
                during delivery or soon after. Due to this situation, new mothers feel 
                extremely unhappy, sad, exhausted, unfit and anxious.</p><br>
                
            <h3><strong>Psychotic Depression</strong></h3>
            <p>This situation can occur if the person is also suffering from some sort of 
                a psychotic issue. Psychotic people suffer from delusions and hallucinations 
                which mess with their ability to interact with the real world. Most psychotic 
                patients that understand they are hallucinating suffer due to their sickness, 
                making them easily susceptible to depression. They also often suffer from 
                guilt, hearing imaginary upsetting words that affect their mood, other 
                illnesses causing psychosis.</p><br>

            <h3><strong> Premenstrual Depression</strong></h3>
            <p>This is a common occurrence for most women that they experience just before 
                their monthly period. The hormone rise and fall can cause irritability, 
                mood swings, unhappy for no reason among other signs. This is a temporary 
                situation and goes away when the period starts.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Atypical Depression</strong></h3>
            <p>This is very similar to major depression but much worse in symptoms. 
                Those with Atypical Depression find themselves being very tired, weak, 
                lethargic, getting more and more sleep and eating without engaging in any 
                exercise. They are likely to put on a lot of weight and be extremely 
                sensitive to others opinions.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Seasonal Affective Depression</strong></h3>
            <p>Feeling better and worse depending on the seasons is seasonal depression. 
                For those with this problem, winters and summers may feel good while 
                autumn and spring trigger their depressive symptoms. These symptoms are 
                usually the normal depressive symptoms which involve lethargy, fatigue, 
                too much sleep or no sleep, eating disorders, etc.</p>

            <h3><strong>Clinical Depression</strong></h3>
            <p>This is not necessarily a type of depression. Rather, any type of depression 
                that a professional clinician diagnosis falls under this category. However, 
                this is not a term anyone uses very often anymore.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-3">10 Noticeable Symptoms of Depression</h2>
            <p>Below are some of the most common and noticeable depressive symptoms.</p>

            <h3><strong>Feeling hopeless</strong></h3>
            <p>This is one of the striking features of someone who is going through 
                depression. In their eyes the world does not make sense, everything is 
                going bad and nothing will get better again. They do not believe that 
                better days are coming and are likely to have a bleak and dead outlook 
                on life without any hope.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Feeling worthless</strong></h3>    
            <p>they may have a strong sense of feeling not good enough. Also, they believe 
                they are worthless and are very hard on themselves. They also believe 
                that they do not deserve good things.</p><br>

            <h3><strong> Losing interest in life</strong></h3>
            <p>They are likely to be distant in association and overall happenings of life. 
                They are no longer taking an interest in things that used to enlighten 
                them and excited them. Sex, hobbies, people they love, hardly matter anymore. 
                It is almost as if joy is no longer a part of their life.</p><br>

            <h3><strong> Appetite changes</strong></h3>
            <p>One sign of depression is either overeating or not eating as much as they used 
                to. Severe and significant appetite changes is another sign of depression. 
                For no apparent reason, they may either stop or overeat which will change 
                their body weight drastically.</p><br>

            <h3><strong> Sleep issues</strong></h3>
            <p>Insomnia is another sign of depression. However, just like in the case of 
                appetite, oversleeping is also a sign of depression. An unexplainable 
                change in your/ your loved ones sleeping cycle coupled with some of the 
                other symptoms could suggest depression.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Easily irritable</strong></h3>
            <p>Depressed people are likely to be very easily irritable. A very small 
                incident can trigger them greatly. They are always ready to get violent, 
                mad, angry or agitated and are very difficult to associate due to this.</p><br>

            <h3><strong> Fatigued and lethargic</strong></h3>
            <p>A significant and clear drop of energy is present in those that are going 
                through depression. They are unlikely to take part in activities and are 
                more likely to sleep all day or stay on a couch without much interaction.</p><br>            

            <h3><strong>Trouble focusing</strong> </h3>
            <p>Those with depression can have trouble paying attention to detail. They can 
                no longer succeed in school or work because they are likely to doze off and 
                not focus on their responsibilities. If you notice a sudden drop in your 
                child’s performance at school or your loved one losing the job they used 
                to love, you may need to pay attention to their mental health.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Bodily pains without an explanation</strong></h3>
            <p>even though depression is a mental health problem, signs can sometimes 
                appear physically. Unexplained body pains and aches that do not have an 
                explanation or a clear way of origin could be a depression indication.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Impulsive behaviour</strong> </h3>
            <p>Those who have depression have very low regard for life. They are already 
                hopeless and feeling worthless so they will take a jump at risky behaviour, 
                substance abuse, speeding or engaging in risky sports.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-4">What can cause depression?</h2>
            <p>Pay attention to the below factors that are most likely to be the 
                reason behind depression according to research.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Genetics</strong></h3>
            <p>Like many other disorders, depression can run in the blood. If one’s parents, 
                siblings or close relative is suffering from depression, there is a chance 
                that the rest of the family can have it. However, someone who is perfectly 
                happy and content is going to be depressed out of nowhere just because of 
                their genes. If this does become a problem, that is due to a trigger.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Stress and life issues</strong></h3>
            <p>This is the most common reason for depression. Lasting stress can develop 
                into depression with the continuous strain it has on one’s mental health. 
                When difficulties such as poverty, unemployment, fights, abuse, isolation 
                and loneliness and stress at work for a long time can cause depression. 
                Those who are in relationships where their significant other does not care 
                are also prone to being depressed. Add to this are the sudden or significant 
                events that take place in one’s life such as a death of a loved one, losing a
                 job, divorce, being diagnosed with a serious or incurable disease are at a 
                 better chance of getting depressed. If the genetic factor is already there, 
                 these things can be very easy triggers.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Drug/ Alcohol or Substance use</strong></h3>
            <p>This can happen in two ways. Those with alcohol or drug addiction are likely 
                to be already depressed and have started using these external and temporary 
                escapes when life got too hard. However, drug and alcohol abuse can lead to 
                depression as well. This can be due to family problems, social problems, 
                work-related problems etc.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Unhealthy life habits</strong></h3>
            <p>Eating things that one should not consume too much, not getting any exercise
                 or being active, drug or alcohol usage, are some of the unhealthy habits 
                 that can lead to depression. Being overweight and underweight or attracting 
                 illnesses due to the lack of exercising can take a toll on someone physical 
                 health and ultimately their mental health.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Long term use of medication</strong></h3>
            <p>Medications have a lot of side effects which are most common to their kind 
                depending on the illness. Some of these are fatigue, drowsiness, appetite 
                loss, etc. Long term usage of such medications can lead to someone suffer 
                from permanent, drowsy, sleepy, and generally inactive 
                and uninterested in life. Also depending on the illness the stress 
                of medication can change. For example, a person diagnosed with psychosis 
                knows that they are only able to stay in touch with reality if they take 
                the medication on time. This puts a strain on ones mental health by making 
                one feel permanently sick and abnormal.</p><br>

            <h3><strong> Grief and loss</strong></h3>
            <p>Experiencing a sudden and significant loss can also turn someone world 
                around in a heartbeat. When that happens they may have a hard time getting 
                through the pain and coming back to their life. In other words, they are 
                going to be in a cycle of moaning and grieving causing depression. 
                Examples for this situation can be finding out your long term partner 
                cheated, the sudden death of your pet, the death of a parent, sibling or 
                a loved one or if the patient is somehow indirectly or directly involved 
                in these deaths.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-5">How depression varies based on age and gender</h2>
            <p>Men are less likely to acknowledge or get help for their depression. 
                However, this in no way means that they are less likely to suffer from 
                depression. According to research, men’s suicidal rate is 4 times higher 
                than that of women. Suicide becomes a choice when you do not receive or 
                reach out for help as soon as the symptoms come into notice. Social norms 
                of toxic masculinity where men can not ask for help in the fear of looking 
                weak plays a huge part in this problem. When men are going through depression, 
                they are more likely to be angry, hostile, distant, and get into drug or 
                substance abuse.</p>
            <p>Women are more likely to get help for their symptoms which are mostly 
                oversleeping, weight gain, guilt, overeating, etc. As opposed to men, 
                hormones play a huge role in depression women might experience. For example, 
                pregnancy, postpartum depression, post and premenstrual depression and 
                menopause.</p>
            <p>Teenagers are prone to mood swings and other behavioural changes with the 
                rapid transition they go through at this age. Their depression is mostly 
                caused by rejection or feeling unwanted, which can lead to hopelessness, 
                feeling unworthy, which will come out in the form of anger, agitation and 
                bodily symptoms such as headaches or body aches.</p>
            <p>While the smallest children refuse to go to school, are clingy, agitated, 
                sad and cries too often, the oldest adults are more likely to distance 
                themselves from society and spend a lot of alone time. They are also more 
                prone to bodily symptoms of depression.</p><br>

            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-6">Who is at risk of developing Depression?</h2>
            <p>Depression is most of the time a result of a mix of different causes than a 
                single factor. In other words, if you just lost a loved one, got kicked out 
                of your job and also got diagnosed with a serious disease such as cancer, 
                the stress may have you drinking and getting high to escape the pain, 
                which ultimately leads to being distant from family and friends. 
                The combination of these elements could lead to depression.</p>
            <p>Below are a few seasons that can make an individual vulnerable and 
                an easy target for depression.</p><br>

            <h3><strong> Living a lonely life</strong></h3>
            <p>Social support and having a circle one can go to or at least talk to on a 
                daily basis is essential. Loneliness can make one feel isolated and will 
                have them bottle up everything with nobody to share them with. This can 
                eventually lead to depression. However, those who are going through are 
                more likely to spend time on their own and withdraw from the rest of 
                the world. Thus, if one does get depressive symptoms due to loneliness, 
                others can hardly know because they are going to stick to being lonely.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Relationship problems</strong> </h3>
            <p>The scary side to being in a committed relationship is the fact that a big 
                and important portion of your mental health can depend on your partner’s 
                behaviour and conduct. Thus, if a relationship starts to fall apart, 
                if one side starts pulling back, cheats or show indifference and stop 
                caring, it can take a toll on the person who is still willing to commit. 
                They can start feeling unwanted, unworthy, angry at the world, and are 
                likely to focus on drugs and alcohol. Usually, they put in the extra 
                work to make the other stay, and are likely to end up alone, which will 
                make things worse. Also, abusive, troublesome and mentally and physically 
                draining relationships also cause depression. When one side of the 
                commitment is going through abuse by the other, there is no happiness 
                but rage, sadness, and heavy negative feelings.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Going through a stressful time in life</strong> </h3>
            <p>When life hits you with stressful situations, again and again, the negative 
                feelings can overwhelm you to the point you give up. If an individual is 
                going through either one or more stressful situations, he or she can get 
                depressive symptoms unless they take care of their mentality with more 
                attention.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Depression genes</strong></h3>
            <p>When one has had a family history of this issue, they are more likely to 
                have depression genes, which can easily make them a victim of depression. 
                Thus, if one has had such a family history, they need to be extra careful 
                with their mental health to make sure they do not succumb to depression. 
                In other words, making good lifestyle choices, being mentally and physically
                 healthy and having hobbies that relax them can eliminate the problem before
                  it has a chance to happen.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Personality traits</strong></h3>
            <p>If one tends to worry too much, has anxiety, is very sensitive etc. 
                they can be more prone to depression than the others. Due to these traits, 
                they are more likely to be vulnerable to incidents, no matter how small 
                or insignificant they are.</p><br>
            
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-7">Can depression be treated?</h2>
            <p>Is depression treatable? Yes. Can depression be cured? That part mostly 
                depends on those who are depressed and if they are willing to put in the 
                work or not.</p>
            <p>Medication, counselling, psychotherapy and brain stimulation therapy can 
                significantly reduce depressive symptoms in people. However, all of these 
                methods include at least 70% that need the effort of the person who wants 
                to not be a victim of depression. If that work is not put forth, none of 
                these methods can help to their full potential.</p><br>
                
            <h2 class="mt-3" id="topic-8">Tips to avoid depression</h2>
            <p>Follow these basic steps to make sure that your mentality never 
                hits the rock bottom.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As soon as you notice depressive symptoms, reach out for help. The faster you get help, 
                    the easier it is to treat it.</li>
                <h3><strong>Healthy lifestyle</strong></h3>
                <li>Follow a healthy lifestyle. Eat right, get good sleep and sleep enough. 
                    Engage in exercise, and be physically healthy.</li>
                <li>It is impossible to avoid stress. However, try 
                    your best so you can avoid at least a few scenarios.</li>
                <li>Practice yoga and other mindfulness-based therapy and exercises. 
                    Like mentioned before, we must deal with stress. However, by maintaining 
                    a calm and soothing mind, you can come out of stressful situations 
                    without being very affected.</li>
                <li>Adopt a few healthy hobbies and maybe a puppy! 
                    Pets have proven to be very effective stress controllers.</li>
                <li>Do what you love. Be it painting, singing, dancing, or even working 
                    out or going for a run. Don’t let your life get dull and routinely. 
                    Change and mix up a few things here and there so 
                    every day is exciting.</li>
                <li>Take it slow on the alcohol and drugs. Remember, if you are looking 
                    to avoid depression, none of these substances will help. If you feel 
                    like you are already addicted, work on taking things down a little. 
                    You will not be able to stop overnight. However, if you keep working 
                    on controlling it, you will be able to stop before it is too late.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3><strong>Healthy circle</strong> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain a close and healthy circle. Keep in touch with your family. 
                    Do not let yourself get lonely and settle into isolation. Visit a friend, 
                    go for a night out and keep your life interesting.</li>
                <li>If medication and other therapy are prescribed, make sure you attend
                     those without failure. By keeping up with those you will be free of 
                     depression before you know it.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <h3><strong>Positivity</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain a positive attitude towards life. While you work out, think of
                     how good you will look because of it. While you eat healthy food, 
                     tell yourself that your body is healthy and unlikely to be sick anytime 
                     soon. Have meaning and purpose to everything you do so you won’t get 
                     tired of doing them.</li>
            <li>Celebrate. Love yourself and take pride in your achievements. be happy for 
                others as well. Good vibes and good moods take you very far from being 
                depressed.</li>
            </ul><br>
